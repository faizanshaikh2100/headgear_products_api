Not only the vocals, even the instruments convey every emotion as you hear them in their finest detail. The super-wide soundstage lets you feel your music come alive. Enjoy music that flows through a range of frequencies from 7Hz to 120KHz. Like the diaphragm, even the metal mesh stators have a super-fine grating that let sound waves lower than 1 million hertz pass through without any distortion. The stators are crafted using a specialised metallic alloy. This gives you sonic stability with acoustically transparent audio.\n\nHIGHLY OPTIMIZED THIN DIAPHRAGM FOR CLEAR SOUND\n\nFor the best sound experience, the HiFiMAN - Shangri-La Jr comes with a diaphragm that is so fine (0.001mm), it is thinner than a strand of human hair. It has a nanoparticle coating which enables it to move extremely fast and gives you an unsurpassed high-frequency response.\n\n6SN7N VACUUM TUBES FOR A WARM SOUND\n\nItâ€™s not just the HiFiMAN - Shangri-La Jr that creates the magic you listen to but also the amp that comes with it. This amplifier has the finest hand-matched 6SN7N vacuum tubes. These tubes function closely to the output and give you a warm luxurious sound quality, one at par only with the best.\n\n24-STEP ATTENUATOR FOR PRECISION\n\nSay goodbye to noise, even during the slightest change in volume. The 24-step attenuator ensures that there is no added distortion in the system.\n\nDESIGNED KEEPING YOUR UTMOST COMFORT IN MIND\n\nThe HiFiMAN - Shangri-La Jr has been designed keeping in mind long music-listening sessions. The headphone is lightweight while the soft headband is adjustable and ensures supreme comfort. The open-backed design gives you a view of the driver hard at work. The sleek look of the amp enhances any tabletop. Visitors are certainly going to come over for a second look.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nNanotech Driver\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7Hz - 12kHz\n\nBIAS VOLTAGE\n550V-650V\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear (Circumaural)\n\nHEADPHONE STYLE\nOpen-Back\n\nWEIGHT\n13.2oz (374g)\n\nDIMENSIONS\n400 x 265 x 108 mm3 (15.7\" x 10.4\" x 4.2\")\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

To claim warranty read more here.\n\nWhat is the difference between the HiFiMAN - Shangri-La and HiFiMAN - Shangri-La Jr?\n\nIn a nutshell: The HiFiMAN Shangri-La has a 300B vacuum tube amp while the HiFiMAN Shangri-La Jr has a 6SN7N vacuum tube amp. An important decision. Choose wisely.\n\nElectrostatic...hmmm...is there any danger of getting a shock?\n\nNo, these headphones are absolutely safe and you do not need to worry about getting a shock. There are many resistors to keep the current low. There is also a relay-based system that cuts off the output if there is any problem in the amp.\n\nIs there any risk of arcing?\n\nArcing is a situation when the voltage passing through the headphone increases suddenly and is transferred from one electrode to the diaphragm/ other electrode. This can cause heavy damage to the driver unit. Fortunately, the Shangri-La jr comes with a nanometer-thick dust cover that prevents arcing.\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this HiFiMAN Shangri-La Jr comes with a 1 year warranty from HiFiMAN that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty. Read more about HiFiMAN's warranty in India.\n\nBEST OPEN HEADPHONES 2021\nHEADFONICS Dec, 2021",

In order to claim warranty, please visit our Audio-Technica warranty page. We are very helpful guys, just saying.\n\nThe sound signature of the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x is?\n\nVery flat. Essentially made for professional studio monitoring, you can expect a neutral sound from the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. Bassheads, leave now before you set yourself up for disappointment.\n\nIs the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x ideal for DJs?\n\nNo, they are not. You can have a look at the V-MODA Crossfade LP2 as it is ideal for DJ and live shows.\n\nDoes the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x come with an open-back design?\n\nNo, it doesnâ€™t. If you are looking for a wide soundstage our top recommendation will be the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro. It features an open-back design with much more detailing as compared to the ATH-M50x.\n\nWill Audio-Technica ATH-M50x require an Amp?\n\nAlthough your smartphone and laptop will be able to drive it, an amplifier would certainly bring out the true potential of the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. Read more about amplification and why it's important here.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x and the Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro?\n\nThe Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro will have a flatter response, as accurate to the source as possible. The Audio-Technica ATH-M50x will have relatively extended low end in comparison.\n\nDoes detachable cable mean I can use it without the wire as well?\n\nNo, they canâ€™t. Detachable cables mean they can be replaced when they go south!\n\nAre Audio-Technica ATH-M50x built to last? Could I use it when travelling?\n\nYes, they are durable and are travel friendly since they fold and a travel carry pouch is also included with the product.\n\nCould I change the parts if they wear out?\n\nYes, we provide high quality replacement parts for the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. You can replace the headband and the earpads from Headphone Zone directly.\n\nHow many cables does the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x come with?\n\nThe product comes with 3 cables: 3.9 to 9.8' (1.2 to 3 m) Coiled Cable, 9.8' (3 m) Straight Cable and 3.9' (1.2 m) Straight Cable. Who doesn't like options?\n\nWhat devices is the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x compatible with?\n\nThese headphones are mostly used by studio professionals and come with a 6.3mm adaptor for use with consoles. You can also use the 3.5mm jack with your laptop or smartphone.\n\nIs Audio-Technica ATH-M50x an ideal product for everyday casual use?\n\nIdeally no. Because these require a dedicated amp for the best quality and because they're quite flat sounding, we wouldn't recommend these to casual music listeners.\n\nHow do Audio-Technica ATH-M50x stack up against Ultrasone Performance 820?\n\nBoth these headphones are flagship products under the 10k range having their strenghts and usability. To help understand better we have an easy to understand blog comparing the Audio Technica M50x vs Ultrasone Performance 820 here.\n\nBUYING GUIDE\n\nBest Headphones under 10000 in 2020\nby Abhijeeth Shetty February 27, 2020\nScan through the list with our go-to guide of headphones under Rs. 10000 to find the best one for you.\nRead More\n\nBeyerdynamic DT 770 Pro vs Audio-Technica ATH-M50x\nby Abhijeeth Shetty March 04, 2020\nComparing the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro and Audio Technica ATH M50X.

It is a combination of an over-ear with a special tube amplifier that offers a sound worthy of it. This custom-made amp features the finest 300B tubes for an audio quality like none other.\n\n24-SETUP LEVEL OF VOLUME CONTROL\n\nSay goodbye to noise, even during the slightest change in volume. The 24-step level of volume control uses 23 separate resistors. This makes each volume level independent of the others.\n\nHIGHLY OPTIMIZED THIN DIAPHRAGM FOR CLEAR SOUND\n\nFor the best sound experience, the Shangri-La comes with a diaphragm that is so fine (0.001mm), it is thinner than a strand of human hair. It has a nanoparticle coating which enables it to move extremely fast and gives you an unsurpassed high-frequency response.\n\nDISTORTION FREE SUPERIOR SONIC EXPERIENCE\n\nEnjoy music that flows through a range of frequencies from 7Hz to 120KHz. Like the diaphragm, even the metal mesh stators have a super-fine grating that let sound waves lower than 1 million hertz pass through without any distortion. The stators are crafted using a specialised metallic alloy. This gives you sonic stability with acoustically transparent audio.\n\nEXPERIENCE 300B FOR REAL\n\nMost headphones/amps come with transformers and capacitors to increase the voltage and drive the diaphragm. The Shangri-La has neither. Thus, nothing comes between the headphone and amp and you can directly listen to the four 300B vacuum tubes.\n\nFLAGSHIP LEVEL COMFORT WITH SOFT HEADBAND, SPACIOUS EARPADS\n\nThe Shangri-La has been designed keeping in mind long music-listening sessions. The headphone is lightweight while the soft head pad is adjustable and ensures supreme comfort. The open-backed design gives you a view of the driver hard at work. Visitors are certainly going to come over for a second look.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nNanotech Driver\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7Hz - 12kHz\n\nBIAS VOLTAGE\n550-650V\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear (Circumaural)\n\nHEADPHONE STYLE\nOpen-Back\n\nWEIGHT\n13.2oz (374g)\n\nDIMENSIONS\n17.32\" x 18.11\" x 13.39\" (437.8*458.9*335.8mm)\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

To claim warranty read more here.\n\nWhat sort of headphone is this?\n\nThe Shangri-La is an electrostatic headphone. It uses a diaphragm that is statically charged and is repelled/attracted to the stators nearby. You can read more about it here.\n\nElectrostatic...hmmm...is there any danger of getting a shock?\n\nNo, these headphones are absolutely safe and you do not need to worry about getting a shock. There are many resistors to keep the current low. There is also a relay-based system that cuts off the output if there is any problem in the amp.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Shangri-La and Shangri-La jr?\n\nIn a nutshell: The Shangri-La has a 300B vacuum tube amp while the Shangri-La jr has a 6SN7N vacuum tube amp. An important decision. Choose wisely.\n\nIs there any risk of arcing?\n\nArcing is a situation when the voltage passing through the headphone increases suddenly and is transferred from one electrode to the diaphragm/ other electrode. This can cause heavy damage to the driver unit. Fortunately, the Shangri-La comes with a nanometer-thick dust cover that prevents arcing.\n\nBuying Guide\n\nThe World's Most Expensive Headphones You Won't Believe Exist\nby Abhijeeth Shetty May 09, 2020\nThe sole purpose of these expensive headphones is to deliver the ultimate music listening experience which you won't find in low-end headphones.\nRead More\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this HiFiMAN Shangri-La comes with a 1 year warranty from HiFiMAN that covers manufacturing defects.

However, unlike other STAX Earspeakers, it features a different design for its deep powerful sound and is hence, an Earspeaker like no other. The unique electrode structure has a gold-plated outer edge. Unlike other Earspeakers, these electrodes do not have any holes, causing the diaphragm to vibrate more. This not only gives you a rich powerful sound but also lets you experience the delicate details in your music.\n\nRIGID METAL HOUSING, EXTREME COMFORT & HIGH-QUALITY AUDIO\n\nTo thoroughly eliminate distortion, STAX encases the sound element in a thick insulated resin case. This case is firmly attached to the SR-007MK2â€™s body. This makes sure that only the diaphragm vibrates, giving you a sound thatâ€™s almost magical. The SR-007MK2 is made for long listening sessions. The soft lambskin earpads are adjustable so that they fit your head perfectly. For a great sound, the SR-007MK2 uses a Pure Crystal Ohno Continuous Casting (PC-OCC) cable. This 2.5m (8.2 feet) cable has a low capacity and wide format which ensures that you only get high-quality audio when you plug it in.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n6 - 41,000Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n170k Î© (10kHz)\n\nSENSITIVITY\n100dB / 100V r.m.s. 1 kHz\n\nBIAS VOLTAGE\n580V DC\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nTYPE\nPush-Pull electrostatic circular sound element, Open-Air type enclosure\n\nCAPACITANCE\n94pF (including cable)\n\nLEFT & RIGHT CHANNEL IDENTIFICATION\n'L' and 'R' indicated on the cable entrance point, solid line (left) and dotted line (right) on the cable\n\nCABLE\nLow capacity wide format, PC-OCC (Pure Crystal Ohno Continuous Casting) 2.5m/8.2ft\n\nAMBIENT TEMPREATURE AND HUMIDITY\n0 to 35ÂºC / 90% max. without condensation\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nEAR PADS\nGenuine Lamb Leather (direct skin contact), high-quality synthetic leather (surrounding portion)\n\nWEIGHT\n12.9oz without cable / 1.1lb with cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1. STAX SR-007MK2\n\n2. Hard Travel Case\n\nFAQs\n\nIs this an open or closed-backed headphone? Can I carry it along with me?\n\nThe SR-007MK2 is an open-backed headphone so it is certainly not the best option for a long commute. But if youâ€™d prefer a headphone for listening at home, this should certainly be your pick. Still confused? Maybe this article could help you out.\n\nWhat is the cable like?\n\nThe SR-007MK2 has a 2.5m wide Pure Crystal Ohno Continuous Casting (PC-OCC). Itâ€™s quality at its best!\n\nWhat is the warranty like and whom should I contact?\n\nSTAX offers a manufacturerâ€™s warranty of 1 year. In case you need to claim warranty or read more about it, hereâ€™s the place you need to be.\n\nCan I use the SR-007MK2 with my phone?\n\nNope, you canâ€™t. The STAX SR-007MK2 has an impedance of 145K Ohms. Headphones with higher impedance need more power to run and your smartphone wonâ€™t be able to generate that. You will need an amp for this. To understand more about impedance and its effect on your beloved headphone, check out this article.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this STAX SR-007MK2 comes with a 1 year warranty from STAX that covers manufacturing defects.

But the latest version of the Sundara is perhaps the best. You need a serious amplifier to drive this planar magnetic headphone but paired properly, these are a fantastic headphone for any audiophile.\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone.

To claim warranty read more on HiFiMAN warranty here.\n\nHow does the HiFiMAN Sundara sound?\n\nThe HiFiMAN Sundara comes with a Balanced sound signature focusing more on the mids with deep bass. Also, with the open back design the sound stage in the Sundara is wider and has great sound separation.\n\nDoes the HiFiMAN Sundara require an amp?\n\nAlthough your smartphone and laptop will be able to drive it, an amplifier would certainly bring out the true potential of the HiFiMAN - Sundara. Read more about amplification and why it's important here.\n\nDoes the HiFiMAN Sundara come with detachable cables?\n\nYes, the cables are indeed detachable. Making for easy storage and convenient for whenever you want to replace or upgrade cables.\n\nCan I use the HiFiMAN Sundara for long listening sessions?\n\nThe Sundara comes with extra soft earpads and itâ€™s over-ear design makes them comfortable to wear for long hours.\n\nDoes the HiFiMAN Sundara comes with a mic?\n\nNo, the HiFiMAN Sundara does not come with a microphone.\n\nWhat is the impedance on the HiFiMAN Sundara?\n\nThe HiFiMAN Sundara comes with an impedance of 37Î©.\n\nWhat do â€œImpedanceâ€ and â€œOhmsâ€ mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î©.\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this HiFiMAN Sundara comes with a 1 year warranty from HiFiMAN that covers manufacturing defects.

Thats the 99 Neo. And I absolutely love them. Its also tuned with a more laidback and warmer sound for a more modern signature.\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone. An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away. On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nA HEADPHONE THAT'S JUST AS SPECIAL AS YOU\n\nThe Meze 99 Neo is beautiful. Made from cast zinc alloy with a coal-black electroplated coating, it combines a contemporary black look with the best of the materials. The thickly padded memory earcups make a product that not only looks luxurious but also makes you feel special.\n\n40MM NEODYMIUM MAGNETS FOR A RICH, BALANCED SOUND\n\nA 40mm Neodymium magnet is placed on the side of each earcup and is designed to resonate in harmony providing a nice and wide soundstage. Rather than resorting to artificially tuned frequencies, the drivers provide dynamic contrast for a more natural listening experience.\n\nCOMFORTABLE FOR LONG LISTENING SESSIONS\n\nMeze has done exhaustive research in order to find the right material and technology for each component of the 99 Neo.

For more warranty details click here.\n\nWhat is the difference between DT 1990 Pro and Amiron Home?\n\nAs a reference headphone for studio applications, the DT 1990 PRO features an accurate resolution and a differentiated stereo image. With a detailed reproduction of highs, it is the ideal tool for a precise analysis of the audio material to be processed. The Amiron home unfolds its full potential mainly at home. It combines a very precise bass with transparent mids and pleasantly clear highs. Its warm, laid-back sound with a fascinating spaciousness is excellently suitable for a relaxed listening to the music and provides a top-class audiophile listening experience..\n\nWhich plug is used for the detachable cable of DT 1770 / 1990 Pro?\n\nThis is a three-pin mini-XLR connection, the male part in the left earcup, the female one on the cable. Pressing the small button on the female plug unlocks the connection. The pin assignment is as follows: (3) - left hot, (2) - right hot, (1) - common return. The other end of the cable is equipped with a stereo minijack (1/8\") with a screwable 1/4\" adapter.\n\nWhat's the difference between the DT 770/990 Pro and the DT 1770/1990 Pro?\n\nThe DT 770/990 PRO is made for musicians, sound engineers, producers as well as beginners looking for a reliable, sturdy and affordable pair of headphones as a working device. The DT 1770/1990 PRO was developed for sound engineers, producers, and musicians looking for a pair of high-end studio headphones with uncompromising performance in all relevant aspects such as sound, design, comfort, and accessories.\n\nWhat do \"Impedance\" and \"Ohms\" mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î© like the T 1.\n\nHow is the overall sound of Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 Pro?\n\nBeyerdynamic is a German brand that has made its mark as a fine headphone manufacturer and the DT 1990 Pro model gives a warm and smooth sound.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO come with a mic?\n\nNo, the Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pro does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nIs the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO an over the ear or on the ear product?\n\nIt is a open-back over-the-ear headphone which makes listening to music better since it gives that natural sound output.\n\nHow is the overall fit of Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO?\n\nBeyerdynamic - DT 1990 Pro fits over the ear and has plush earpads, making it a comfortable headphone to wear for long hours at a stretch.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO have detachable cables?\n\nYes, the cables are indeed detachable. Making for easy storage and convenient for whenever you want replace or upgrade cables.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO work well and loud enough with mobile phones ?\n\nIt gives enough output to be loud but then it also depends on your phone's internal amp and DAC\n\nAre the DT 1990 PRO good for long useage?\n\nYes, you can use the DT 1990 Pro for a long time as it comes with high-tech textiles, and memory foam filled ear pads ensure exceptional wearing comfort.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO need an Amplifier?\n\nYes, since it has a high impedence which cannot be driven by a smartphone an Amp gives it the extra boost to the sound.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Beyerdynamic DT 1990 PRO comes with a 2 year warranty from Beyerdynamic that covers manufacturing defects.

This is done with its 50mm dual-diaphragm drivers and superior materials. With this headphone, you can experience pure audio without the artificial processing of battery-powered headsets. To ensure that these are ready for use and can consistently hit all notes, the Crossfade LP2 is tested at 6 different frequencies.\n\nFLEXIBLE. STURDY. RUGGED.\n\nBe it a range of temperatures, salt spray, humidity or UV exposure, the Crossfade LP2 will never let you down. It is built with a steel frame and interchangeable aircraft-grade metal shields. The SteelFlex headband is so flexible, it can bend flat more than 10 times while the cable can bend over a million times. The V-MODA Crossfade LP2 is tested according to Military-Level Quality MIL-STD-810G Test Standards. You can also carry your Crossfade LP2 safely wherever you'd like. Just slip it in the Exoskeleton case & you're good to go.\n\nERGONOMIC FIT FOR MAXIMUM ISOLATION AND MINIMUM SOUND LEAK\n\nMore than 4 years of R&D have resulted in the ergonomic headband and hexagon-shaped earcups that does away with fatigue. The BLISS foam ear cushions take the shape of your ears for added comfort and noise isolation. Analogue sound isolation cuts out all outside noise while letting you enjoy your music without worrying about (a lot of) sound leakage.\n\nTRUSTED BY MORE THAN 200 DJS, GRAMMY-WINNING MUSICIANS, AUDIOPHILES AND ARTISTS\n\nV-MODA headphones are known for their blend of good looks that do not compromise on functionality. The Hex design, CliqFold, SharePlay, and V-CORK are a few of their patented or yet to be patented innovations.

    "description": "Designed in Germany\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Movies and TV\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\n56mm Dynamic Drivers\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nOUTSTANDING REFERENCE QUALITY AUDIO REPRODUCTION\n\nThe Sennheiser HD 800s sport an open, circum-aural dynamic stereo headphone design that makes you feel directly connected to the music. Music emerges from silence and sounds so profound that would travel into a soundstage of amazement. Soundstage refers to being able to sense the spatial surroundings of a recording.\n\nPATENTED DYNAMIC TRANSDUCER TECHNOLOGY\n\nHeadphones have always had a basic physics problem when it comes to transducers. Better sound always requires a larger surface area but this also results in more distortion due to oscillation at high frequencies. Sennheiser essentially blew everyoneâ€™s mind when they showed off the Neodymium-powered two-layer ring radiator inside the HD 800 S. Firing at your ear in a strategic 60-degree angle to simulate free-air sound arrivals it has claimed to sport the largest diameter ever seen for such applications.\n\nRING RADIATOR DRIVER TECHNOLOGY FOR CONTROLLED OSCILLATIONS\n\nThe 56mm or 2.205\" (with a 40mm voice coil) is twice the size of your average tweeter. Generally, you don't encounter them until you shell out about 100 times that for the full speaker. This results in controlled oscillations, which leave the headphones to do what headphones do best, that is create the best and clearest sound possible.\n\nCOMFORTABLE CIRCUMAURAL DESIGN WITH ALCANTARA EARCUPS\n\nThe Japanese Alcantra Earcups boast of suede-like fabric material that youâ€™ll find used for the interior of many high-end automobiles and racecars. It definitely feels like an airy version of suede, as it doesn't have the heft of most leather materials. Also the fabric breathes, which is great for long listening sessions when you donâ€™t want to have to air out your ears. Handcrafted ear pads made of high-quality microfiber fabric and the ear cups are covered with a thin metallic mesh.\n\nINGENIOUS KEVLAR-REINFORCED CABLES FOR MINIMAL LOSS\n\n3 meters of fabric-sheathed Kevlar-reinforced Teflon-insulated 4-strand straight OFC copper wire in a Y harness. The cable is covered with a fabric sheath, making it flexible and non-microphonic. Two connection leads, a 6.3mm connector and an XLR-4 balanced cable to offer even better quality sound from sources with balanced outputs.\n\nOPEN-BACK DESIGN FOR AN AIRY, EXPANSIVE SOUNDSTAGE\n\nAny set of headphones that give a real sense of â€˜being thereâ€™ are open-backed, meaning that air and sound can come in and out of the headphones. The sound has less of a â€˜laboratory feelâ€™ this way. Itâ€™s not great for noise isolation, as people will be able to hear whatever music or movies that youâ€™re listening to.\n\nDESIGNED KEEPING WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION AND COMFORTABILITY IN MIND\n\nThe headphones come in at a pretty heavy sounding 11.5 oz (or 330 grams for the metric folk), but they manage to distribute the weight evenly so that you donâ€™t really notice the weight at all. They are large headphones and cover even the largest of ears. But they feel light and after a two-hour film, your head wonâ€™t be sore at all.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nTRANSDUCER PRINCIPLE\nDynamic Open\n\nIMPEDANCE\n300 Ohms\n\nTHD\n0.02 % (1 kHz 1 Vrms)\n\nCONTACT PRESSURE\n~ 3,4 N (Â± 0,3 N)\n\nSENSITIVITY\n102 dB @ 1 kHz\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 â€“ 51000 Hz (- 10 dB)\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n700 mW\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nNeodymium\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n6.35 mm/ 4.4 mm XLR-4 (optional)\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nWEIGHT\n330g\n\nCOLOR\nblack\n\nCABLE TYPE\nFabric-sheathed Kevlar-reinforced Teflon-insulated 4-strand straight OFC copper wire\n\nCABLE LENGTH\n3m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

I would listen to every genre track on them. It's gorgeous to look at, and sounds better than anything else in the segment. They're timeliness. I hope to hand them to my kids someday.\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone. An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away. On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nA HEADPHONE AS UNIQUE AND AWESOME AS YOU!\n\nExperience pure luxury in terms of looks and sound with the Meze 99 Classics. This headphone has been lovingly handcrafted from wood and the satin-finished wood grain makes each headphone unique, just like your fingerprint. With these, Meze has worked to change the perception of headphones from being seen as technical devices or cheap plastic accessories to a mature product that you'll fall in love with.\n\nA RICH NATURAL SOUND\n\nEnjoy a crisp, balanced sound with the Meze 99 Classics. The 40mm neodymium drivers offer a clear, undistorted sound. Just sit back and put these on to enjoy the gorgeous sound of plucked strings, upbeat grooves or thumping beats that's natural and lifelike. In addition, the snug medium density memory foam keeps away noise while offering superior noise isolation.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY AND LUXURY IN EVERY ELEMENT\n\nApart from wood, the 99 Classics also use cast zinc and manganese spring steel. The headband ensures even pressure for long listening sessions. The headpad and earpads are made from PU leather. Everything is then put together using nuts and bolts. This makes the headphone fully serviceable. The entire headphone is made from only premium materials, no glue or plastic.\n\nMADE WITH CARE USING AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS\n\nEach Meze 99 Classics takes almost 45 days to be made. The wood used is harvested from mature trees that have reached the end of their life cycle. This ensures that there is no harm done to the environment while giving you that rich, natural sound. To further enhance the colours, the wood goes through extensive air drying and shaping by hand and CNC machines, a process that takes almost 8 hours. It then goes through sanding, lacquering, finishing, careful inspection and is finally assembled.\n\nSpecs\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n40mm\n\nIMPEDANCE\n32Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n103dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15Hz - 25,000Hz\n\nRATED INPUT POWER\n30mW\n\nMAXIMUM INPUT POWER\n50mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n260g\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nEAR-CUPS\nWalnut Wood\n\nCABLE\nKevlar OFC cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

I would listen to every genre track on them. It's gorgeous to look at, and sounds better than anything else in the segment. They're timeliness. I hope to hand them to my kids someday.\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone. An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away. On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nA HEADPHONE AS UNIQUE AND AWESOME AS YOU!\n\nExperience pure luxury in terms of looks and sound with the Meze 99 Classics. This headphone has been lovingly handcrafted from wood and the satin-finished wood grain makes each headphone unique, just like your fingerprint. With these, Meze has worked to change the perception of headphones from being seen as technical devices or cheap plastic accessories to a mature product that you'll fall in love with.\n\nA RICH NATURAL SOUND\n\nEnjoy a crisp, balanced sound with the Meze 99 Classics. The 40mm neodymium drivers offer a clear, undistorted sound. Just sit back and put these on to enjoy the gorgeous sound of plucked strings, upbeat grooves or thumping beats that's natural and lifelike. In addition, the snug medium density memory foam keeps away noise while offering superior noise isolation.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY AND LUXURY IN EVERY ELEMENT\n\nApart from wood, the 99 Classics also use cast zinc and manganese spring steel. The headband ensures even pressure for long listening sessions. The headpad and earpads are made from PU leather. Everything is then put together using nuts and bolts. This makes the headphone fully serviceable. The entire headphone is made from only premium materials, no glue or plastic.\n\nMADE WITH CARE USING AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS\n\nEach Meze 99 Classics takes almost 45 days to be made. The wood used is harvested from mature trees that have reached the end of their life cycle. This ensures that there is no harm done to the environment while giving you that rich, natural sound. To further enhance the colours, the wood goes through extensive air drying and shaping by hand and CNC machines, a process that takes almost 8 hours. It then goes through sanding, lacquering, finishing, careful inspection and is finally assembled.\n\nSpecs\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n40mm\n\nIMPEDANCE\n32Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n103dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15Hz - 25,000Hz\n\nRATED INPUT POWER\n30mW\n\nMAXIMUM INPUT POWER\n50mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n260g\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nEAR-CUPS\nWalnut Wood\n\nCABLE\nKevlar OFC cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

Due to its closed design with a high ambient noise attenuation, it is perfect for users in loud environments such as sound engineers when listening to PA systems or musicians.\n\nMAXIMUM PRECISION, MINIMUM LEAKAGE\n\nThe closed-back design offers a wide soundstage and excellent resolution together with a precise, natural bass output making these headphones the top pick for professional studio use. Background noise is effectively suppressed, and leakage minimized thanks to the closed-back design. The DT 1770 Pro walks the fine line between pure flat response and slight boosting in certain frequency ranges to allow for clarity, richness, and depth. The clean highs are balanced with full-bodied, deep bass.\n\n45MM DYNAMIC TESLA DRIVERS\n\nEmploying Beyerdynamic's Tesla 2.0 technology for the first time in professional headphones, the drivers utilize a triple layer composite diaphragm to reduce \"partial oscillations,\" which results in a more detailed audio performance.\n\nRUGGED BUILD AND REPLACEABLE COMPONENTS\n\nThe DT 1770 PRO is very durable. The headband has been constructed from steel and replaceable headband pads that are high on comfort for long listening sessions. All components are replaceable and ensure a long lifetime of the headphone.\n\nTWO PAIRS OF EARPADS, TWO SOUNDS\n\nTwo pairs of ear pads are included in order to achieve the ideal sound characteristic depending on the use case. Velour ear pads provide an open sound and are perfect for mixing and mastering. A pair of leatherette ear pads provide a more closed sound making the headphones more well suited to monitoring applications.\n\nA PLETHORA OF ACCESSORIES\n\nThe headphones come with two detachable cables, one straight and one coiled; a premium protective carry case, two sets of velour & leatherette earpads and two gold-plated Â¼-inch headphone jack adapters.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n45 mm\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nTesla Driver\n\nMAGNET\nNeodymium\n\nIMPEDANCE\n250Î©\n\nSENSITIVITY\n102 dB @ 1 kHz\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5Hz - 40,000Hz\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n200 mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n388g\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

For more warranty details click here.\n\nHow is the overall sound of Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 Pro?\n\nBeyerdynamic is a German brand that has made its mark as a fine headphone manufacturer and the DT 1770 Pro model gives clean highs along with a deep bass sound.\n\nWill the DT 1770 Pro replace the DT 770 Pro?\n\nYes, the DT 1770 PRO is an advanced version of the DT 770 PRO, made for audio engineers, producers and musicians who need a pair of high-end studio headphones with uncompromising performance in all relevant aspects such as sound, design, comfort, and accessories.\n\nWhich plug is used for the detachable cable of DT 1770 / 1990 Pro?\n\nThis is a three-pin mini-XLR connection, the male part in the left earcup, the female one on the cable. Pressing the small button on the female plug unlocks the connection. The pin assignment is as follows: (3) - left hot, (2) - right hot, (1) - common return. The other end of the cable is equipped with a stereo minijack (1/8\") with a screwable 1/4\" adapter.\n\nWhat's the difference between the DT 770/990 Pro and the DT 1770/1990 Pro?\n\nThe DT 770/990 PRO is made for musicians, sound engineers, producers as well as beginners looking for a reliable, sturdy and affordable pair of headphones as a working device. The DT 1770/1990 PRO was developed for sound engineers, producers, and musicians looking for a pair of high-end studio headphones with uncompromising performance in all relevant aspects such as sound, design, comfort, and accessories.\n\nWhat do \"Impedance\" and \"Ohms\" mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î© like the T 1.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO come with a mic?\n\nNo, the Beyerdynamic DT 1770 Pro does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nIs the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO an over the ear or on the ear product?\n\nIt is a closed-back over-the-ear headphone which makes listening to music even better thanks to its natural noise isolation.\n\nHow is the overall fit of Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO?\n\nBeyerdynamic - DT 1770 Pro fits over the ear and comes with plush pads, which make it plenty comfortable for the majority of users.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO have detachable cables?\n\nThe cables are indeed detachable.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO work well and loud enough with mobile phones ?\n\nIt will work, but not well enough to do justice to the product.

All the earpads are filled with carefully chosen acoustical foam for the best fit and sound.\n\nEXTENDED FREQUENCIES & LOWER DISTORTION WITH FAZORS\n\nFazors are special acoustical elements positioned on either side of the magnetic structure.

A few of the benefits include extended frequency response, improved high-frequency extension, and lowered distortion, with better imaging.\n\nAUDEZE'S INNOVATIVE PLANAR MAGNETS\n\nAcoustically engineered for accuracy Audezeâ€™s innovative planar magnetic technology delivers a clear and accurate sound that reveals everything on the recording. The LCD-X (Music Creator's Special) has an efficient push-pull magnetic structure that is specially designed and self-closing. This ensures an acoustically transparent music listening experience. The Double-sided Neodymium magnet arrays deliver a uniform driving force across the entire diaphragm for a near-zero distortion.\n\nPROPRIETARY LOTUS DIAPHRAGM FOR A SMOOTH SOUND\n\nAudeze's proprietary Lotus diaphragm has a printed circuit across most of its surface and is capable of handling maximum continuous operating temperatures of over 400Â° F. This gives the drivers a smooth, resonance-free frequency response, excellent internal damping, edge damping, very low distortion and an extremely fast transient response.\n\nMIX & MASTER ANYWHERE & EVERYWHERE\n\nNot everyone can listen to their headphones in an acoustically treated room. With the Audeze Reveal plugin, you can add custom filter presets to all Audeze flagships. Now, mix and master in virtually any location, be it the studio, your home or even on top of an active volcano.\n\nENGINEERED TO PERFECTION\n\nThe LCD-X (Music Creator's Special) is thoroughly engineered and meticulously hand-built using the finest, most luxurious materials combined with cutting-edge planar magnetic technology in California, U.S.A.

Step into a new world of music, full of rich detail, low-end clarity and overall accuracy.\n\nENJOY EXTENDED FREQUENCIES & LOWER DISTORTION\n\nThe LCD-3 uses Fazors, special acoustical elements positioned on either side of the magnetic structure. They enhance transparency by affecting the sound waves generated by large planar diaphragms. A few of the benefits include extended frequency response, improved high-frequency extension and lowered distortion, with better imaging.\n\nEXPERIENCE AUDEZE'S PROPRIETARY PLANAR MAGNETIC DRIVERS\n\nRather than use standard headphone drivers that operate like miniature woofers or tweeters, the LCD-3 uses a large, 6.17-square-inch thin-film planar magnetic driver that's embedded with Audeze's proprietary Lotus diaphragm that's thinner than a human hair for fast response times. This gives a smooth, resonance-free frequency response, excellent internal damping, edge damping, very low distortion and extremely fast transient response.\n\nMIX & MASTER ANYWHERE & EVERYWHERE\n\nNot everyone can listen to their headphones in an acoustically treated room. With the Audeze Reveal plugin, you can add custom filter presets to all Audeze flagships. Now, mix and master in virtually any location, be it the studio, your home or even on top of an active volcano.\n\nHANDCRAFTED WITH PREMIUM MATERIALS\n\nMade in the USA, the Audeze LCD-3 are handcrafted using high-quality luxurious materials. It features Audeze's tonal balance and powerful bass that beautifully articulates the power and nuance of your favourite music. The gorgeous wooden rings are designed for the audiophile with a discerning ear & style. The real lambskin leather or Microsuede earpads and headband use acoustical foam for the best fit and sound.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n15W (for 200ms)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n110 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n102dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5Hz â€“ 20kHz extended out to 50kHz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nNeodymium\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm to 1/4in stereo adaptor\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nCABLE TYPE\n2.5m 1/4in to dual 4-pin mini-XLR cable, 2.5m 4-pin XLR to dual 4-pin, Mini-XLR cable\n\nWEIGHT\n543g\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

Also the high quality design only helps in better sonic experience delivering a surreal soundstage experience and natural sound.\n\nOPEN CIRCUMAURAL DESIGN FOR DETAILING\n\nTThe DT 990 Pro features an open-back circumaural over-the-ear design for rich audio performance that's designed for critical listening and a more natural sound stage. This increased efficiency also leaves the DT 990 Pro with greater power reserves for a succinct linear response that is especially suited for high-achieving audio applications where appropriate sonic reproduction is of paramount importance, and dedicated equipment is available such as a headphone amplifier.\n\nADJUSTABLE HEADBAND, VELOUR EARPADS FOR ADDED COMFORT\n\nBeyerdynamic developed The DT series in order to deliver optimal sound in a wide variety of applications and situations.They're dynamic with their headphone designs well suited for a broad range of environments.\n\nERGONOMIC AND DURABLE BUILD SHOWCASING 90+ YEARS OF GERMAN EXCELLENCE\n\nThe headband has been made with solid spring steel that makes these headphones durable and adds to their comfort feature since they come with two pairs of earpads: Padded faux leather and Velour.

For more warranty details click here.\n\nHow is the overall sound of Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro?\n\nBeyerdynamic is a German brand that has made its mark as a fine headphone manufacturer and the DT 990 Pro model gives a neutral and clear sound.\n\nDoes Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro come with a mic?\n\nNo, the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nIs Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro an over the ear or on the ear product?\n\nIt is a semi open over-the-ear headphone which gives a slightly increased sound isolation and reduced noise leakage\n\nHow is the overall fit?\n\nBeyerdynamic DT 990Â Pro comes with an adjustable headband so that it firmly and comfortably cradles your head.\n\nDoes Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro have detachable cables?\n\nNo,it does not have detachable cable.\n\nWhich devices are compatible?\n\nThe DT 990 Pro is compatible with Android and iOS devices as well as studio monitoring eqiupments.\n\nIs Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro good for long useage?\n\nYes, due to it being durable, lightweight and soft earpads make music listening for long hours comfortable\n\nDoes it need an Amplifier?\n\nYes, since the driver units are bigger, they will need an amplifier so that the headphones can performance to its full potential.\n\nWhich hard case can I buy for my Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro?\n\nYou can get the Beyerdynamic - DT Hard Case for your DT 990 Pro.\n\nWhy isn't there a 600-ohms version of DT 990 Pro?\n\nSince most headphone output in professional environments isn't designed for 600-ohms headphones, Beyerdynamic only offers headphones with a maximum impedance of 250-ohms.\n\nWhat is the technical difference between DT 880/990 edition and DT 880/990 Pro?\n\nThe Pro series is designed for professional users and the Edition series are designed for end users. Also, the Pro and Edition series do not differ noticeably in terms of sound provided that they have the same impedance (e.g. the 250 ohms DT 880 Edition and the 250 ohms DT 880 Pro sound the same).\n\nHow does the Tygr 300 R differ from the DT 880 Pro and the DT 990 Pro?\n\nThe DT 880 PRO has a very linear frequency response, while the DT 990 PRO has a slightly more accentuated bass and accordingly more present trebles for a pleasant balance. Both are primarily designed for studio applications. The TYGR 300 R focuses on gaming. Powerful bass and detailed accentuated treble go very well with gaming. However, the sound design of the DT 990 PRO has been further optimized for gaming, sometimes through the use of a special acoustic fleece.\n\nHow can I tell what the impedance of my DT 770/880/990 Edition is?\n\nYou check the impedance of the integrated sound transducers from the connection plug. The impedance is sometimes hot-embossed onto the plastic shaft of the plug: If there is nothing there, the model has an impedance of 250 ohms. If it reads 32 Î©, the model has an impedance of 32 ohms. If it reads 600 Î©, the model has an impedance of 600 ohms.\n\nWhat do \"impedance\" and \"ohms\" mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î© like the T 1.\n\nAre the DT 990 Pro Available with less headband pressure?\n\nNo, the professional headphones are only available with the defined headband pressure. If the headband pressure is too strong for you, you can slightly try to expand the installed spring steel in the headband. For this purpose, we recommend stretching the headphones gradually for a few hours over books or similar. You should choose the width a little bit wider than the width of your head.\n\nBuying Guide\n\n10+ of the Best Over Ear Headphones in 2020\nby Abhijeeth Shetty May 09, 2020\nOver-ear headphones are one of the most popular types of headphones.

Read more about amplification and why it's important here.\n\nWhat does â€œImpedanceâ€ and â€œOhmsâ€ mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î©.\n\nWarranty & Media Reviews\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Campfire Audio Dorado 2020 comes with a 2 year warranty from Campfire Audio that covers manufacturing defects.

Screw Driver, used to adjust the variable bass\n\nSERVICE DETAILS\n\nWARRANTY\nNA\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nYearlong Research for the Most Optimum Fit\n\nJH Audio is renowned worldwide for their custom IEMs that provide deep bass response and excellent sonic performance. With this kind of expertise, it was only natural that the engineers fine tune their Universal IEMs fit-wise, to be as close to Custom IEMs as possible. JH Audioâ€™s guys analyzed over 30,000 sets of ear molds in their Orlando Lab to find similarities in order to create the Performance Series IEMs. What they found was that most of the sound bores on Custom IEMs bore a similarity of having a 10% angle. Having identified this, JH Audio made the necessary sound bore adjustments and refined the shape of the ear bowl and helix area. The result? A Universal IEM that fits and seals almost as well as a Custom IEM.\n\nJerry Harvey\nJerry Harvey started his career as a sound engineer and shortly he picked up the legendary band Van Halen. Jerry Harvey thus came about the world's first Custom In-Ear Monitor. This became extremely popular with the band members and then he started making them for other brands as well. Jerry finally founded JH audio in 2007 as a manufacturer of custom aviation headsets and then started producing the JH Audio Pro series for professionals and audiophiles alike.\n\nPerformance-Series\n\nFor a custom-like experience, Jerry Harvey Audio has introduced the Performance series Universal Fit IEMs. These Universal series allows you to hear the music how the recording artist and mix engineer intended. The models achieve what no others have before: a smaller shell size to ensure proper fit, retention and an acoustic seal for a perfect IEM experience.\n\nHandcrafted in the US\n\nJerry Harvey Audio has manufactured the entire Performance Series Universal IEM range in their US facility. JH Audio sincerely believes in old school craftsmanship, while employing the most cutting edge technology in order to create the worldâ€™s greatest IEMs.\n\nTriple Bore with FreqPhase Steel Tube Waveguide\n\nThe FreqPhase corrects time and phase of multiple drivers. The waveguide ensures each driver signal arrives within 0.01 milliseconds, leading to a Phase coherent IEM.\n\nSoundrIVe Technology (Quad Driver Technology)\n\nJH13V2 is equipped with SoundrIVe Technology, using Jerry Harvey Audioâ€™s proprietary mini quad drivers. The JH13V2 has a 8 balanced armature driver configuration: dual drivers for the lows, dual drivers for the mids, and quad drivers for the highs.\n\nStunning Custom Mahogany Faceplates\nEverything about the JH Audio Performance Series of Universal IEMs is stunning. The JH13V2's new custom mahogany faceplates are adorned with oversized teal JH logos which you'd think look too over-the-top, but actually look pretty darn good-looking!\n\nAssembled, Matched & Finished by Hand\n\nThe Performance Series is truly exquisite in its design. After the unique shells go through the 3D printing process, the Universal IEMs are then, one pair at a time, finished and assembled in the JHA facility. Unlike other manufacturers that only match their IEMs within 3db +/- of their reference curves, JH Audio tests and matches their Universal IEMs to within an astounding 1db +/- of their reference curve. This level of attention to detail is simply unheard in this industry.\n\nState of the Art 3D Modeling & Printing Technology\n\nJH Audio just invested in their very own 3D printing system that cost them a quarter of a million dollars. Whew! This investment has surely paid off as weâ€™ve not seen more gorgeous looking IEMs anywhere. Every single angle on the new Performance Series 3D shell has been carefully redesigned to be smaller and fit all kinds of ear sizes more naturally. The Performance Series IEMs and their fancy new shells give a perfect seal for a comfy fit every time.\n\nIntegrated 3-Way Crossover\n\nThe JH13V2 has an impressive and sophisticated crossover network. This crossover circuit combined with the Freqphase waveguide and new proprietary quad drivers deliver an audio quality that is perfect for the recording studio, or for listening to exactly what the mixer/producer and band wanted you to hear, mixing your own tracks or performing live.\n\nVariable Bass Output that is Adjustable from the Cable\n\nYou can control the low frequency drivers with the adjustable bass (0 - +10dB) from the cable itself. Frequency ranges from flat bass response up to +10dB (10Hz to 100Hz).\n\nSee More\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n8 Drivers\n\nIMPEDANCE\n28 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n116dB @ 1mW\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n10Hz to 20kHz\n\nNOISE ISOLATION\n26db\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE TYPE\nTangle-free cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

Read more on warranty claim here.\n\nHow does the Sennheiser HD 560S sound?\n\nThe HD 560S treats your ears to audiophile sound quality. With great clarity over the mids and the highs and itâ€™s wide soundstage takes your music listening experience to a next level.\n\nDoes the Sennheiser HD 560S come with a mic?\n\nNo, the Sennheiser HD 560S does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nCan I use the Sennheiser HD 560S for long hours?\n\nThe Sennheiser HD 560S is made of lightweight durable plastics that allows you to use them for long hours without experiencing fatigue. The soft leather headband and over-ear design with memory foam earpads also helps in the same.\n\nDo I require an amp to drive the Sennheiser HD 560S?\n\nYes, to bring the best of these headphones an Amp is recommended. You could have a look at our collection of portable Amps here and desktop Amps here.\n\nWhat is the impedance on the Sennheiser HD 560S?\n\nThe Sennheiser HD 560S comes with the impedance of 120Î©.\n\nWhat do â€œImpedanceâ€ and â€œOhmsâ€ mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î©.\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEW\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Sennheiser HD 560S comes with a 2 year warranty from Sennheiser that covers manufacturing defects.

In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î©.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Shure AONIC 215 comes with a 2 year warranty from Shure that covers manufacturing defects.

You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î©.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Shure AONIC 215 comes with a 2 year warranty from Shure that covers manufacturing defects.

The open-back nature makes it a little susceptible to sound leakage. The T1â€™s drivers are tilted to achieve the most spatial sound signature possible. As a result, the music appears â€œin frontâ€ on centre stage. As an alternative to the T1, the T5 is available with a closed-back design.\n\nHI-RES ZERTIFIZIERUNG FOR LOSSLESS AUDIO PLAYBACK\n\nThe T1 headphones are also Hi-Res Audio certified and provide lossless high-resolution sound. This means your music of choice keeps all of its musical details and nuances during playback and sounds as close as possible to the original recording.\n\nFINEST MATERIAL OF BESTE QUALITÃ„T MAKES IT A HI-END THROUGH AND THROUGH\n\nThe T1 screams quality through and through. Only high-quality materials are used in the T1 headphones. The housing covers are made from finely brushed, lacquered aluminium. The plug-in cables are covered in fabric and contain conductors made from ultra-high-purity OCC7N copper ensuring optimum signal transmission. The use of AlcantaraÂ® gives the model that certain something that elevates it to a truly high-end set of headphones.\n\nMEMORY FOAM EARPADS DESIGNED FOR EXTREME KOMFORT\n\nThe replaceable ear pads made from protein-coated leatherette contain a multi-layer filling which helps fine-tune the sound while also making the headphones extremely comfortable to wear. One of the layers is made from memory foam which adapts to each user and ensures an excellent customised fit. As a result, nothing can stand in the way of a long listening session.\n\nSPECS\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nTRANSDUCER\nDynamic\n\nOPERATING PRINCIPLE\nOpen-back\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5â€“50,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n32 Î©\n\nT.H.D\n<0.05% (800 Hz / 1 mW)\n\nNOMINAL SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL\n100 dB (1 mW)\n\nPOWER HANDLING CAPACITY\n300 mW Max.\n\nSOUND PRESSURE LEVEL\n124 dB (300 mW) Sound\n\nCOUPLING TO THE EARS\nOver-ear\n\nHEADBAND PRESSURE\nApprox. 4 N\n\nCABLE\n3 m, double-sided\n\nCONNECTOR\nGold-plated, three-pole stereo jack plug, 3.5 mm, and screwed adapter, 6.35 mm\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

The SR-L500MK2 has taken the excellent sound of the original series and combined it with a newly designed enclosure. The STAX SR-L500MK2 is an advanced Earspeaker that features tough stainless fixed electrodes and a hand-selected thin-film diaphragm. Expect the perfect balance of delicate treble, soothing mids and deep bass.\n\nDESIGNED FOR LONG LISTENING SESSIONS\n\nThe SR-L500MK2 has been designed keeping comfort and long listening sessions in mind. The headband (ARC) has a 10-click slider mechanism that allows you to adjust the head pad's height. Once adjusted, the slider ensures that it stays put doing away with the need of constantly readjusting the height. The plush handcrafted earpads are made of high-quality synthetic leather that adds to the comfort as well as the sound performance.\n\nCABLES THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR PERFECTION\n\nThe detachable cable uses HiFCâ„¢ (High-Performance Pure Copper) wires developed by Hitachi. These wires have the same sonic characteristics as the SR-009 and SR-L500's 6N high-purity 99.99999% copper wires. The cable is designed in a wide, flat format to reduce the capacitance between each wire and drive the SR-L500MK2 in a more effective manner.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7 - 41,000Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n145k Î© (including cable, at 10kHz)\n\nSOUND PRESSURE SENSITIVITY\n101dB / 100V r.m.s. 1 kHz\n\nBIAS VOLTAGE\n580V DC\n\nMAXIMUM SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL\n118dB / 400Hz\n\nELECTROSTATIC CAPACITANCE\n110pF (including cable)\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nLEFT & RIGHT CHANNEL IDENTIFICATION \"L\" and \"R\" indicated on the arc assembly Left channel cable is marked with a solid line.

STAX SR-L500MK2\n\n2. Instruction Manual\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the warranty period on the STAX - SR-L500MK2?\n\nSTAX - SR-L500MK2 offers a 1 year warranty. If you need to claim warranty, you can contact us. We are quite friendly people, just sayin. You can read more about warranty here.\n\nHow does the STAX - SR-L500MK2 sound?\n\nIt delivers a clear, transparent and balanced sound with delicate highs, soothing mids and deep bass.\n\nCan I use the STAX - SR-L500MK2 with my smartphone?\n\nNope, you canâ€™t. The STAX - SR-L500MK2 has an impedance of 145K Ohms. Headphones with higher impedance need more power to run and your smartphone wonâ€™t be able to generate that. You will need an amp for this.\n\nWhat is the impedance on the STAX - SR-L500MK2?\n\nThe STAX - SR-L500MK2 has an impedance of 145kÎ©.\n\nWhat is the cable like on STAX - SR-L500MK2?\n\nThe STAX - SR-L500MK2 comes with OFC parallel 6-strand cables.\n\nCan I use the STAX - SR-L500MK2 for long hours?\n\nThe STAX - SR-L500MK2 is made of lightweight durable materials that allows you to use them for long hours without experiencing fatigue. The soft leather headband and over-ear design with memory foam earpads also helps in the same.\n\nWhat do â€œImpedanceâ€ and â€œOhmsâ€ mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î©.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this STAX SR-L500MK2 comes with a 1 year warranty from STAX that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty. Read more about STAX's warranty in India.\n\nHOME HEADPHONES\nSOUND IMAGE AWARDS Dec, 2021",

STAX SR-L300\n\n2. STAX SRM-252S\n\n3. Instruction Manual\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the warranty period on the STAX - SRS-3100?\n\nSTAX - SRS-3100 offers a 1 year warranty. If you need to claim warranty, you can contact us. We are quite friendly people, just sayin. You can read more about warranty here.\n\nHow does the STAX - SRS-3100 sound?\n\nIt delivers a clear, transparent and balanced sound with delicate highs, soothing mids and deep bass.\n\nCan I use the STAX - SRS-3100 with my smartphone?\n\nNope, you canâ€™t. The STAX - SRS-3100 has an impedance of 145K Ohms. Headphones with higher impedance need more power to run and your smartphone wonâ€™t be able to generate that. You will need an amp for this.\n\nWhat is the impedance on the STAX - SRS-3100?\n\nThe STAX - SRS-3100 has an impedance of 145kÎ©.\n\nWhat is the cable like on STAX - SRS-3100? /button>\n\nThe STAX - SRS-3100 comes with OFC parallel 6-strand cables.\n\nCan I use the STAX - SRS-3100 for long hours? /button>\n\nThe STAX - SRS-3100 is made of lightweight durable materials that allows you to use them for long hours without experiencing fatigue. The soft leather headband and over-ear design with memory foam earpads also helps in the same.\n\nWhat do â€œImpedanceâ€ and â€œOhmsâ€ mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î©.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this STAX SRS-3100 comes with a 1 year warranty from STAX that covers manufacturing defects.

So the next time you can enjoy the vocals of your favourite artist in great detail and accuracy. You also get a brand-new high-purity silver-plated cable which improves the performance of the highs and the lows. The blend of metal and resin design along with bright colour options gives the KZ ZSN Pro X a refreshing new look.\n\nHIGH-GRADE ACOUSTIC TECHNOLOGY FOR UNRIVALLED SONIC PERFORMANCE\n\nThese earphones come with a refined and dynamic 10mm dual magnetic driver delivering sonic excellence. Oftentimes, magnetic drivers have to deal with magnetic gaps but that's not the case with the KZ ZSN Pro X.

This cable features 100 core high-purity silver-plated cable with 4 strands of wire tightly wound, elevating the audio resolution. The result of this cable is wide and natural-sounding audio with minimum distortion and loss in signal transmission. These cables come embedded with an HD condenser microphone allowing communication. This microphone is a high-quality mic capable of transmitting clean audio. There are quick-access functions assigned to the button on the microphone housing and it allows for receiving calls, rejecting calls, playing/pausing music and changing the songs played. This is truly useful as you donâ€™t need to access your devices to execute these frequently used functions.\n\n2PIN CONNECTOR WITH DETACHABLE CABLE ALLOWING FOR UPGRADABILITY\n\nThe design for the KZ ZSN Pro X is carefully engineered, featuring a 2PIN connector and detachable cables. The detachable nature of the cable allows the earphones to be able to attach to different cable accessories. KZ ZSN PRO X supports the additional Bluetooth module and can be easily upgraded to a wireless headset.\n\nFEATURING ALLOY-SHELL DESIGN WHICH GIVES A STUNNING LOOK TO YOUR KZ ZSN PRO X\n\nThe streamlined metal and resin design gives a strikingly unique look to your KZ ZSN Pro X.

He loves the RAI Penta and the Empyrean, equally. When not writing about, thinking about or listening to music: He's an avid beerologist too and staunchly believes that the combination of both beats every music setup out there! You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nUPGRADED KZ ZSN PRO X FEATURING A HYBRID DRIVER SETUP\n\nThere has been a significant number of changes done to the all-new KZ ZSN Pro X. It features a customised 30095 high frequency balanced armature and a 10mm mid-bass low-frequency dynamic driver in a hybrid setup. Tuned flawlessly by a dedicated team of acoustic engineers, the KZ ZSN Pro X has a balanced armature driver. Dynamic lows, soothing mids and clear highs are adjusted to perfection. So the next time you can enjoy the vocals of your favourite artist in great detail and accuracy. You also get a brand-new high-purity silver-plated cable which improves the performance of the highs and the lows. The blend of metal and resin design along with bright colour options gives the KZ ZSN Pro X a refreshing new look.\n\nHIGH-GRADE ACOUSTIC TECHNOLOGY FOR UNRIVALLED SONIC PERFORMANCE\n\nThese earphones come with a refined and dynamic 10mm dual magnetic driver delivering sonic excellence. Oftentimes, magnetic drivers have to deal with magnetic gaps but that's not the case with the KZ ZSN Pro X. The magnetic driver of the ZSN Pro X is optimised to reduce magnetic gaps and to prevent eddy current loss. This paves the way for an enhanced low-frequency power and allows for wider frequency response ensuring a comprehensive music listening experience.\n\nCOMFORT ELEVATING FIT FOR PERFECT NOISE ISOLATION\n\nThe in-ear fit is all about comfort. Comfort that helps you enjoy your music even for extended hours. The KZ ZSN Pro X offers that comfort with an ergonomically designed curved cavity. This cavity is uniquely engineered to ensure that comfort is not lost even when you are wearing these earphones for too long. Not just that, this comfort-elevating fit also leads to effective noise isolation for peaceful music listening.\n\nPREMIUM 100 CORE SILVER-PLATED CABLE WITH HD MICROPHONE AND IN-LINE CONTROLS\n\nThe cable bundled with the KZ ZSN Pro X is built with high-quality materials, offering superior audio transmission. This cable features 100 core high-purity silver-plated cable with 4 strands of wire tightly wound, elevating the audio resolution. The result of this cable is wide and natural-sounding audio with minimum distortion and loss in signal transmission. These cables come embedded with an HD condenser microphone allowing communication. This microphone is a high-quality mic capable of transmitting clean audio. There are quick-access functions assigned to the button on the microphone housing and it allows for receiving calls, rejecting calls, playing/pausing music and changing the songs played. This is truly useful as you donâ€™t need to access your devices to execute these frequently used functions.\n\n2PIN CONNECTOR WITH DETACHABLE CABLE ALLOWING FOR UPGRADABILITY\n\nThe design for the KZ ZSN Pro X is carefully engineered, featuring a 2PIN connector and detachable cables. The detachable nature of the cable allows the earphones to be able to attach to different cable accessories. KZ ZSN PRO X supports the additional Bluetooth module and can be easily upgraded to a wireless headset.\n\nFEATURING ALLOY-SHELL DESIGN WHICH GIVES A STUNNING LOOK TO YOUR KZ ZSN PRO X\n\nThe streamlined metal and resin design gives a strikingly unique look to your KZ ZSN Pro X. The colours breathe new life into the design. High-grade Zinc Alloy is used for the faceplate while the cavity uses imported resin. The blend of unique materials and the use of a wide range of colour options add a modern look to the KZ ZSN Pro X.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n10mm\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nHybrid Driver, 1BA+1DD\n\nIMPEDANCE\n25Î©\n\nSENSITIVITY\n112dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7-40000Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm\n\nPIN TYPE\n0.75mm\n\nPLUG TYPE\nL curved\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE LENGTH\n125Â±5cm\n\nWEIGHT\n27Â±3g\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

    "description": "Designed & Made in the Germany\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nFor Studio & Professionals\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nDynamic Drivers\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nA REVOLUTION IN HEADPHONE TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe first of its kind, full-fledged Air Motion Transformer (AMT) headphones are here. Geared particularly towards audiophiles and professional recording artists around the world, the HEDDphone features AMT which is an electrodynamic transducer that enables faster airflow compared to ordinary systems.\n\nVVTÂ® DIAPHRAGM THAT'S BETTER THAN YOUR AVERAGE DIAPHRAGM\n\nThe HEDDphone uses the patent-pending VVTÂ® diaphragm. It extends the AMT principle to a linear full-range headphone transducer using the latest diaphragm geometry. This upgraded folded diaphragm lets air out four times faster and allows the playback of even the little nuances in the audio recording.\n\nINTRODUCING THE 4TH DRIVER TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe HEDDphone presents a fourth transducer technology that brings high levels of dynamic capabilities and advanced sonic clarity through the AMT principle to high-end headphones. It is designed to deliver excellent performance through precise, unaltered and impactful sound reproduction.\n\n30+ YEARS OF HEDDPHONE INNOVATION\n\nIt all began 30 years ago with HEDD Audio CEO and Chief Engineer Klaus Heinz designing the first AMT tweeter that was inspired by Oskar Heilâ€™s original Air Motion Transformer invention. Since then, it has seen a lot of sonic advancements in its revised versions over the years. The latest (2019) AMT version can be heard in HEDD AudioÂ´s ONE studio monitor line.\n\nSPECS\n\nGENERAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nCONCEPT\nOpen over ear headphone with Air Motion Transformer\n\nEFFICIENCY\n87 dB SPL for 1 mW\n\nIMPEDANCE\n42 Î©\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n10Hzâ€“40kHz\n\nWEIGHT\n718 g\n\nCONNECTOR\nMini XLR\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENT\n1.

To claim warranty read more on HEDD Audio warranty here.\n\nCan I use the HEDD Audio - HEDDphone for long hours?\n\nThe HEDDphone comes with extra soft earpads and itâ€™s over-ear design makes them comfortable to wear for long hours.\n\nAre the cables on the HEDD Audio - HEDDphone detachable?\n\nYes, the cables are indeed detachable. Making for easy storage and convenient for whenever you want to replace or upgrade cables.\n\nWhat is the impedance on the HEDD Audio - HEDDphone?\n\nThe HEDD Audio - HEDDphone Pro comes with impedance of 42Î©.\n\nWhat do â€œImpedanceâ€ and â€œOhmsâ€ mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î©.\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this HEDD Audio HEDDphone comes with a 2 year warranty from HEDD Audio that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty.

It uses Trueflow technology for a warm, authentic sound that's detailed and brings out every nuance. The wide soundstage is immersive, creating a lifelike experience.\n\nPATENT-PENDING TRUEFLOW TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe magnets used in planar magnetic drivers tend to create hard right angles. When sound waves travel through these angles, it creates turbulence in the audio wavelength. This tends to conceal minute details and results in audio that's not true-to-life. The TrueFlow technology fills in the area between magnets with perforated material. This removes the hard angles so that the air moves through a flat, perforated surface resulting in improved dynamics, resolution and an extended frequency response.\n\nDESIGNED & ENGINEERED IN SAN DIEGO\n\nThis headphone has been designed and built in San Diego, California. The lightweight, hinge-free nitinol headband is comfortable and practically indestructible. You get the all-new Vivo cable and travel case along with the Ether Flow 1.1.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nPlanar Magnetic\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n71 x 45mm\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\nYes\n\nIMPEDANCE\n23 ohms\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nEARPAD MATERIAL\nNAPA Lamb Leather\n\nSHIPPING DIMENSIONS\n11 x 9 x 6 inches\n\nSHIPPING WEIGHT\n3lb\n\nWEIGHT\n385g\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

    "description": "Designed in the UK\n\n1 Year of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Movies and TV\n\n1.1\" Tweeter + 4.5\" Wideband Driver\n\nBluetooth with LDAC, aptX HD & AAC\n\nConnect With RCA & 3.5mm\n\nVolume Controls\n\nIdeal for Rooms 75-150sq ft\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nSTYLISH DESIGN THAT ADDS GRANDEUR TO ANY ROOM\n\nThe iFi Audio Aurora is made to mimic grandnessâ€”both in terms of sound and design. Its look has been inspired by French design and Japanese architecture. Julien Haziza, the designer of the Aurora took inspiration from Shigeru Ban, Tadao Ando and the OmotesandÅ and Harajuku districts in Tokyo. With the bamboo and aluminium frame, you get a striking design with a hint of vintage.\n\nFEEL THE MUSIC WITH PUREEMOTIONÂ®\n\nExperience PureEmotionÂ®, a proprietary amp technology that features a hybrid circuit design with multiple key stages. The preamp stage includes a Russian 6N3P from the 2C51 premium tube/valve family. Each half of the tube is used for the left & right channels and adds gain to the audio signal in preparation for further amplification. This signal is delivered by the ESS Sabre Hyperstream DAC chipset which along with AMRâ€™s Global Master Timing (GMT)/ Memory Buffer System, reduces jitter and unneeded noise. This results in a life-like sound that combines the purity of tone with a high level of engagement, speed and dynamic gusto.\n\nSTREAM HIGH-QUALITY MUSIC WIRED AND WIRELESSLY\n\nStream music however you like with the Aurora. It has Bluetooth v5.0 and just about every audio codec i.e. Qualcomm aptX, aptX HD, aptX Low Latency, aptX Adaptive, LDAC, AAC and HWA/LHDC (codecs created by Sony, Apple and Huawei respectively). Using WiFi and LINKPLAYâ„¢, you can link several Auroras to create a multi-room system. Enjoy music from the built-in Tidal and Spotify functionality or play music offline with the micro SDHC cards slot. You can also connect to other devices via a variety of cable inputs like optical, coaxial, USB, 3.5mm and Ethernet.\n\nSTART THE CONCERT IN YOUR HOME\n\nEnjoy a deep, genuine bass with TrueBassÂ®. It includes two downward-firing 8-inch bass radiators and dual-level depth control that lets you adjust the bass response according to your taste, even down to 27Hz. Want to turn your room into a concert hall? Consider it done! With SoundSpaceÂ®, the driver unit array consists of a proprietary matrix that allows you to change the level of output from specific drivers at certain frequencies. This results in an immersive, room-filling soundstage.\n\nAUTO ROOM TAILORING THAT'S SMART AND SOUNDS GOOD\n\nThe Aurora features Auto Room Tailoring (ART)Â®, a â€˜room correctionâ€™ system developed entirely by iFi engineers. Six sensors measure the distance between the Aurora and surrounding walls using ultrasonic sound. Then, a 32-bit ARM Cortex microprocessor adjusts the output from the speaker array to precisely tailor the musical performance according to the room. The result? A deep, voluminous sound that'll make you forget the artificial, tinny sound of systems that use DSP.\n\nSPECS\n\nINPUTS\n\nCODEC\nHi-Res Bluetooth audio with aptxHD/aptX/LDAC/HWA(LHDC)/AAC\n\nSUPPORTING FORMAT\nNetworked Audio with playback from NAS or server, Airplay, streaming audio (Spotify/Apple Music/Amazon Music/Tidal hifi/Deezer etc.) and USB storage /SD Card 44.1kHz/16Bit â€“ 192kHz/32Bit\n\nCOAXIAL AND OPTICAL\nCoaxial and optical S/P-DIF (Blu-ray Player, Games Console, smart TV etc) 44.1kHz/16Bit â€“ 192kHz/24Bit\n\nINPUT\nRCA & 3.5mm (for Alexa or analogue audio)\n\nSPEAKER SYSTEM\n\nDRIVER\n4 x 4.5â€ (120mm) coated paper cone wideband driver\n\nTWEETER\n2 x 1.1â€ (28mm) silk dome tweeter (8 kHz crossover)\n\nRADIATORS\n2 x 4.5â€ x 8â€ (120mm x 200mm) steel passive radiators\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n27Hz â€“ 40kHz\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n115dB / 1m\n\nAMPLIFIER\n\nAMPLIFIER\nHybrid with tube class A amplification.

Moreover, these earphones have a 2-year replacement warranty.\n\nRESULT OF YEARS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nEtymotic is known as the world leader in sound reproduction.

The ATH-R70x is a perfect fit if you like listening to all kinds of genres.\n\nDoes the Audio-Technica - ATH-R70x require an amp?\n\nAlthough your smartphone and laptop will be able to drive it, an amplifier would certainly bring out the true potential of the Audio-Technica ATH-R70x. Read more about amplification and why it's important here.\n\nDoes detachable cable mean I can use it without the wire as well?\n\nNo, they canâ€™t. Detachable cables mean they can be replaced when they go south!\n\nWhat devices is the Audio-Technica ATH-R70x compatible with?\n\nThese headphones are mostly used by studio professionals, you can use the 3.5mm jack with your laptop or smartphone.\n\nDoes the Audio-Technica - ATH-R70x come with a carry pouch?\n\nYes, the Audio-Technica - ATH-R70x does come with a carry pouch in the box.\n\nDoes the Audio-Technica - ATH-R70x come with a carry pouch?\n\nYes, the Audio-Technica - ATH-R70x does come with a carry pouch in the box.\n\nFor mixing which is better, open or closed back headphones?\n\nA closed back headphone is ideally a good choice since it contains the sound within the earpads since they are also over the ear. To understand how they are different from open back read Difference between open back and closed back headphone.\n\nWhat do â€œImpedanceâ€ and â€œOhmsâ€ mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î© like.\n\nDOWNLOADS\nATH-M70x & ATH-R70x Literature\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n3 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Audio-Technica ATH-R70x comes with a 3 year warranty from Audio-Technica that covers manufacturing defects.

    "description": "Designed in France\n\nFlat Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Casual Music Listening\n\nClosed-Back Design\n\nMetal Build\n\n40mm Beryllium Drivers\n\nDetachable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nM-SHAPED BERYLLIUM DOME FOR FLAWLESS SOUND\n\nFocal is known for producing pure acoustic sound for 40 years and the Stellia is definitely one of them. An exceptional headphone, these are equipped with an â€˜Mâ€™-shaped pure Beryllium dome and new surround, frameless 100% copper voice coil that ensures stunning dynamics for this closed-back headphone. The Stellia reveals the tiniest details and realistic audio reproduction.\n\n40MM SPEAKER DRIVERS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Focal Stellia produces the purest sound. Its 40mm electrodynamic speaker drivers offer a frequency range of 5Hz- 40kHz even at the low volume levels. The Vents, EVA foam behind the speaker driver, absorb the high frequencies while the acoustic diffusers break up standing waves resulting in interference-free sound.\n\nSUPERIOR COMFORT AND STYLISH FINISH\n\nStellia is extremely comfortable thanks to the high-resilience memory foam earpads. No matter the size and shape your ears, the consistent curve between the headband and Yoke offers a flawless fit. The Stellia consists of two finishes â€” cognac and mocha. The headband is made from full-grain leather which makes this headphone supremely classy.\n\nLISTEN IN PERFECT ISOLATION\n\nThe Stellia amazingly isolates unwanted outside sound as it has been created with a closed-back design. 50% of the earpads' height is designed to diffuse sound through non-perforated full-grain leather. The other 50% absorbs the audio signal through an acoustic cloth which covers the memory foam which produces the perfect sound isolation.\n\nDESIGNED & ENGINEERED IN FRANCE\n\nThe Stellia uses technology developed exclusively by Focal in France. To ensure that each and every product is high-performance, it has to feature a 100% Focal design. This allows complete control over the design and quality control processes in order to guarantee high-quality loudspeakers, headphones and earphones that offer enduring value.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n\n1.6\" (40mm) pure Beryllium \"M\" shape dome\n\nSENSITIVITY\n\n106dB SPL / 1mW @ 1kHz\n\nTHD @ 1kHz / 100dB SPL\n\n0.1% @ 1kHz / 100 dB SPL\n\nIMPEDANCE\n\n35 Ohms\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5Hzâ€“40kHz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nCONNECTIVITY\nWired\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nGRILL\nClosed-Back\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

These are brand new headphones with cosmetic flaws on the packaging.\n\nWhy Buy Unboxed Headphones?\n\nSave Upto 15%\nSince you won't get the original packaging, we give you a good discount compared to a new headphone.\n\nProfessionally Inspected\nA thorough inspection means you receive a 100% working headphone with no sound output issues.\n\nOriginal Warranty\nAll unboxed headphones carry the same warranty period as a brand new headphone would.\n\nUnbiased Customer Service\nWe have the same Headphone Zone customer support experience for Unboxed Products or new products.\n\nUnchanged ReplacementÂ Policy\nReceived a defective Unboxed unit?

It's easy to change your IEMs from wired to wireless or upgrade the cable with the detachable 2-pin slots.

Integrated with the brand's exclusive technologies, these are their first audiophile circumaural closed-back headphones that's meant to entirely enclose a user's ears and offer great isolation from ambient sound.\n\nDOME-SHAPED DRIVERS THAT OFFER A NATURAL, PRECISE SOUND\n\nElegia's speaker drivers are a mass of innovation dedicated to sound purity. The electrodynamic transducers provide great expansion at the heart of extremely dynamic sound and a linear, extended frequency response of 23 kHz. The geometry of the new, half-roll NBR surrounds guarantees a lightweight moving part that is always under control, even at the lowest frequencies and the highest volumes. The M-shaped inverted dome and the larger emissive surface make every listening session sensational.\n\nSUPERIOR NOISE ISOLATION FOR UNINTERRUPTED MUSIC LISTENING\n\nElegia provides the perfect noise isolation for music lovers out there. Engineers at Focal have worked hard to ensure that the ear cup's fit, vents and earpads give you the perfect isolation so you no longer get disturbed by the surrounding sound. The headphones make sure that there is no resonance or unwanted sound signals hindering your music while the precise, naturalness of the sound is retained.\n\nCREATED TO LOOK, SOUND AND FEEL GOOD\n\nThe Elegia has been designed to perfect the wearer perfectly. The headband, yoke and 20mm memory foam microfibre earpads mould perfectly to the head and face, providing optimal grip and fatigue-free on-the-go use. It uses premium materials like leather, solid aluminium and microfibre to look good, stay durable and add comfort.\n\nDESIGNED & ENGINEERED IN FRANCE\n\nThe Elegia uses technology developed exclusively by Focal in France. To ensure that each and every product is high-performance, it has to feature a 100% Focal design. This allows complete control over the design and quality control processes in order to guarantee high-quality loudspeakers, headphones and earphones that offer enduring value.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n1.57\" (40 mm) 'M'-shape Aluminium/ Magnesium dome\n\nIMPEDANCE\n35 Ohms\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5 Hz-23 kHz\n\nSENSITIVITY\n105 dB SPL / 1 mW @ 1 kHz\n\nTHD\n0.1 % @ 1 kHz / 100 dB SPL\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm and 6.35mm jack adapter\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nGRILL\nClosed-Back\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

He loves the RAI Penta and the Empyrean, equally. When not writing about, thinking about or listening to music: He's an avid beerologist too and staunchly believes that the combination of both beats every music setup out there! You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n4 BALANCED ARMATURES + 1 DYNAMIC DRIVER FOR INCREDIBLE SOUND\n\nAs an upgraded version of the ZS10, the KZ ZS10 Pro uses customised balanced armature drivers, 2 for the high and 2 for the mid frequencies. It also adopts the 2nd generation Tesla double magnetic dynamic unit for the rhythm and bass.\n\nUSES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE YOUR MUSIC COME ALIVE\n\nKZ's independent research and development with dynamic drivers are responsible for the ZS10 Pro's low-frequency output. It is excellently crafted using the PCB electronic frequency division board resulting in smooth and distortion-free sound. The Dual Balanced Armature drivers are responsible for the mid and treble performance. It provides a high-intensity resolution, rich sense of quality and full vocals that makes these IEMs a pure listening experience for you.\n\nDESIGNED TO LOOK GOOD & LAST LONG\n\nThis IEM's faceplate is made of 304 stainless steel while the cavity is made from imported resin. These two different materials add shimmer and an exquisite look to the earphone which also makes them durable and long-lasting. The superior noise isolation cancels out ambient sound.\n\nMADE TO BE FLEXIBLE\n\nThe ZS10 Pro's wire hooks are made of expensive memory metal, which makes it very convenient for users to adjust the earphones around the ear. The cable that comes in the box terminates in a 3.5mm plug and comes with an inline remote & mic. It's easy to change your IEMs from wired to wireless or upgrade the cable with the detachable 2-pin slots. The new limit slot protection design keeps the pins from breaking and ensures a longer life.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\n5 Drivers (4 x BA + 1 x Dynamic)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n24 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n111dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7-40,000Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE LENGHT\n1.2m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

The ZS10 Pro more than delivers with it.\n\nPRAVEEN KAMATH\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout PRAVEEN KAMATH\nPraveen, our Headphone Zone is an audio connoisseur and staunch Meze fanboy. He loves the RAI Penta and the Empyrean, equally. When not writing about, thinking about or listening to music: He's an avid beerologist too and staunchly believes that the combination of both beats every music setup out there! You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n4 BALANCED ARMATURES + 1 DYNAMIC DRIVER FOR INCREDIBLE SOUND\n\nAs an upgraded version of the ZS10, the KZ ZS10 Pro uses customised balanced armature drivers, 2 for the high and 2 for the mid frequencies. It also adopts the 2nd generation Tesla double magnetic dynamic unit for the rhythm and bass.\n\nUSES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE YOUR MUSIC COME ALIVE\n\nKZ's independent research and development with dynamic drivers are responsible for the ZS10 Pro's low-frequency output. It is excellently crafted using the PCB electronic frequency division board resulting in smooth and distortion-free sound. The Dual Balanced Armature drivers are responsible for the mid and treble performance. It provides a high-intensity resolution, rich sense of quality and full vocals that makes these IEMs a pure listening experience for you.\n\nDESIGNED TO LOOK GOOD & LAST LONG\n\nThis IEM's faceplate is made of 304 stainless steel while the cavity is made from imported resin. These two different materials add shimmer and an exquisite look to the earphone which also makes them durable and long-lasting. The superior noise isolation cancels out ambient sound.\n\nMADE TO BE FLEXIBLE\n\nThe ZS10 Pro's wire hooks are made of expensive memory metal, which makes it very convenient for users to adjust the earphones around the ear. The cable that comes in the box terminates in a 3.5mm plug and comes with an inline remote & mic. It's easy to change your IEMs from wired to wireless or upgrade the cable with the detachable 2-pin slots. The new limit slot protection design keeps the pins from breaking and ensures a longer life.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\n5 Drivers (4 x BA + 1 x Dynamic)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n24 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n111dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7-40,000Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE LENGHT\n1.2m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

The ZS10 Pro more than delivers with it.\n\nPRAVEEN KAMATH\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout PRAVEEN KAMATH\nPraveen, our Headphone Zone is an audio connoisseur and staunch Meze fanboy. He loves the RAI Penta and the Empyrean, equally. When not writing about, thinking about or listening to music: He's an avid beerologist too and staunchly believes that the combination of both beats every music setup out there! You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n4 BALANCED ARMATURES + 1 DYNAMIC DRIVER FOR INCREDIBLE SOUND\n\nAs an upgraded version of the ZS10, the KZ ZS10 Pro uses customised balanced armature drivers, 2 for the high and 2 for the mid frequencies. It also adopts the 2nd generation Tesla double magnetic dynamic unit for the rhythm and bass.\n\nUSES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE YOUR MUSIC COME ALIVE\n\nKZ's independent research and development with dynamic drivers are responsible for the ZS10 Pro's low-frequency output. It is excellently crafted using the PCB electronic frequency division board resulting in smooth and distortion-free sound. The Dual Balanced Armature drivers are responsible for the mid and treble performance. It provides a high-intensity resolution, rich sense of quality and full vocals that makes these IEMs a pure listening experience for you.\n\nDESIGNED TO LOOK GOOD & LAST LONG\n\nThis IEM's faceplate is made of 304 stainless steel while the cavity is made from imported resin. These two different materials add shimmer and an exquisite look to the earphone which also makes them durable and long-lasting. The superior noise isolation cancels out ambient sound.\n\nMADE TO BE FLEXIBLE\n\nThe ZS10 Pro's wire hooks are made of expensive memory metal, which makes it very convenient for users to adjust the earphones around the ear. The cable that comes in the box terminates in a 3.5mm plug and comes with an inline remote & mic. It's easy to change your IEMs from wired to wireless or upgrade the cable with the detachable 2-pin slots. The new limit slot protection design keeps the pins from breaking and ensures a longer life.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\n5 Drivers (4 x BA + 1 x Dynamic)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n24 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n111dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7-40,000Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE LENGHT\n1.2m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

The ZS10 Pro more than delivers with it.\n\nPRAVEEN KAMATH\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout PRAVEEN KAMATH\nPraveen, our Headphone Zone is an audio connoisseur and staunch Meze fanboy. He loves the RAI Penta and the Empyrean, equally. When not writing about, thinking about or listening to music: He's an avid beerologist too and staunchly believes that the combination of both beats every music setup out there! You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n4 BALANCED ARMATURES + 1 DYNAMIC DRIVER FOR INCREDIBLE SOUND\n\nAs an upgraded version of the ZS10, the KZ ZS10 Pro uses customised balanced armature drivers, 2 for the high and 2 for the mid frequencies. It also adopts the 2nd generation Tesla double magnetic dynamic unit for the rhythm and bass.\n\nUSES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE YOUR MUSIC COME ALIVE\n\nKZ's independent research and development with dynamic drivers are responsible for the ZS10 Pro's low-frequency output. It is excellently crafted using the PCB electronic frequency division board resulting in smooth and distortion-free sound. The Dual Balanced Armature drivers are responsible for the mid and treble performance. It provides a high-intensity resolution, rich sense of quality and full vocals that makes these IEMs a pure listening experience for you.\n\nDESIGNED TO LOOK GOOD & LAST LONG\n\nThis IEM's faceplate is made of 304 stainless steel while the cavity is made from imported resin. These two different materials add shimmer and an exquisite look to the earphone which also makes them durable and long-lasting. The superior noise isolation cancels out ambient sound.\n\nMADE TO BE FLEXIBLE\n\nThe ZS10 Pro's wire hooks are made of expensive memory metal, which makes it very convenient for users to adjust the earphones around the ear. The cable that comes in the box terminates in a 3.5mm plug and comes with an inline remote & mic. It's easy to change your IEMs from wired to wireless or upgrade the cable with the detachable 2-pin slots. The new limit slot protection design keeps the pins from breaking and ensures a longer life.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\n5 Drivers (4 x BA + 1 x Dynamic)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n24 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n111dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7-40,000Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE LENGHT\n1.2m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

It also adopts the 2nd generation Tesla double magnetic dynamic unit for the rhythm and bass.\n\nUSES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE YOUR MUSIC COME ALIVE\n\nKZ's independent research and development with dynamic drivers are responsible for the ZS10 Pro's low-frequency output. It is excellently crafted using the PCB electronic frequency division board resulting in smooth and distortion-free sound. The Dual Balanced Armature drivers are responsible for the mid and treble performance. It provides a high-intensity resolution, rich sense of quality and full vocals that makes these IEMs a pure listening experience for you.\n\nDESIGNED TO LOOK GOOD & LAST LONG\n\nThis IEM's faceplate is made of 304 stainless steel while the cavity is made from imported resin. These two different materials add shimmer and an exquisite look to the earphone which also makes them durable and long-lasting. The superior noise isolation cancels out ambient sound.\n\nMADE TO BE FLEXIBLE\n\nThe ZS10 Pro's wire hooks are made of expensive memory metal, which makes it very convenient for users to adjust the earphones around the ear. The cable that comes in the box terminates in a 3.5mm plug and comes with an inline remote & mic. It's easy to change your IEMs from wired to wireless or upgrade the cable with the detachable 2-pin slots. The new limit slot protection design keeps the pins from breaking and ensures a longer life.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\n5 Drivers (4 x BA + 1 x Dynamic)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n24 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n111dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7-40,000Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE LENGHT\n1.2m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

He loves the RAI Penta and the Empyrean, equally. When not writing about, thinking about or listening to music: He's an avid beerologist too and staunchly believes that the combination of both beats every music setup out there! You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n4 BALANCED ARMATURES + 1 DYNAMIC DRIVER FOR INCREDIBLE SOUND\n\nAs an upgraded version of the ZS10, the KZ ZS10 Pro uses customised balanced armature drivers, 2 for the high and 2 for the mid frequencies.

It's easy to change your IEMs from wired to wireless or upgrade the cable with the detachable 2-pin slots.

    "description": "Chi-Fi Excellence\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n1 Year of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nPlanar Magnetic Drivers\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nUPGRADED PLANAR MAGNETIC HEADPHONE WITH STEALTH MAGNETS\n\nHiFiMAN is known for introducing technologically advanced headphones to the world and the Arya Stealth Magnet Version is one of them. Unlike the sound waves created by a conventional magnet, the shape of Stealth Magnets enables the waves to pass through the magnets without generating any interference. HiFiMANâ€™s advanced magnet design is acoustically transparent, dramatically reducing wave diffraction turbulence that degrades the integrity of the sound waves. The reduced distortion yields pure sonic output that is accurate and full-range.\n\nPLANAR MAGNETIC EXCELLENCE WITH NANOMETER DIAPHRAGM\n\nWhen it comes to detailed audio retrieval, no factor is more important than the diaphragm. Required to oscillate up to 20,000 times a second, most diaphragms, which are made of plastic or cardboard, canâ€™t overcome the hurdle of their inertia to reproduce lifelike details. The HiFiMAN Arya Stealth Magnet Version, on the other hand, features a diaphragm thatâ€™s only a nanometer thick. This exceptional thinness allows it to reproduce unparalleled details and lifelike imaging that you wonâ€™t find on other headphones.\n\nASYMMETRICAL EAR CUPS WITH PATENTED WINDOW SHADE SYSTEM\n\nThe HiFiMAN Arya Stealth Magnet Version has focused on remarkable sound due to its open-back nature. To support the remarkable sound, the Arya Stealth Magnet Version has been equipped with asymmetrical ear cups to follow the natural shape of the human ears and offer a snug fit. These headphones have also been elevated with the companyâ€™s patented window shade system, which is created to meet the need for driver protection and allows ample space for sound waves to escape, resulting in a highly durable and sonically-pure headphone.\n\nBOLD AESTHETIC WITH METAL AND HIGH-GRADE PLASTIC CONSTRUCTION\n\nThe HiFiMAN Arya Stealth Magnet Version showcases the classic HE1000 style and shapes with its all-black exterior, glossy black headband and eye-catching matte-black cups and grill, the Arya Stealth Magnet Version is a statement of both aesthetic and sonic excellence. The materials used for the build of the headphones are of high quality and the headphone is lightweight as it is made from high-grade plastic and the headband is built with high-grade metal. This makes the headphones durable and comfortable. It perfectly complements the headphone in terms of sound as well as looks.\n\nSTURDY 3.5MM REPLACEABLE CONNECTOR AND CRYSTALLINE COPPER CABLE\n\nThe HiFiMAN Arya Stealth Magnet Version keeps things simple with a single Crystalline Copper cable. Featuring a 6.35mm plug and a jet black woven exterior finish itâ€™s the perfect complement to the sound and sight of the Arya. These headphones also come with a user-replaceable connector design allowing for easy cable swapping, offering durability and enhanced customizability.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nIMPEDANCE\n32Î©\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n8Hz â€“ 65kHz\n\nSENSITIVITY\n94dB\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nPLUG TYPE\n3.5mm\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nHEADPHONE STYLE\nOpen-Back\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

It has high-quality sound and the perfect build with its smart, unique and ergonomic housing. This IEM consists of 4 balanced drivers and 1 dynamic driver making it the perfect sonic combination. Enjoy detailed sound, natural tonality and consistent fit.\n\n5 DRIVER CONFIGURATION FOR POWERFUL PERFORMANCE\n\nThe hybrid technology of the Rai Penta delivers harmonized sound frequencies without the overlay of phase issues. The sound has to pass from the housing to the nozzle and finally to the eartips to reach your eardrums. To make this seamless, the precise length of each sound tube has been created to determine the air volume in front of each driver so that the 5 drivers work smoothly and deliver pure sound.\n\nTHE PERFECT DESIGN FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nMost multi-driver configurations use an imperfect plastic tube and dampener system that result in interference. The Rai Penta's driver does away with this design for clean, pure sound. It delivers a balanced sound signature and also provides extreme detailing to every tune, within a frequency range from 4Hz to 45 kHz. Moreover, you can drive it with just about any and every source device.\n\nCNC ALUMINIUM CHASSIS FOR DISTURBANCE-FREE SOUND\n\nThe finely tuned PES design in front and behind the driver assembly helps in controlling the internal chamber pressure by regulating the airflow. For the sound to be directed to your ears without any disturbance, the CNC aluminium chassis is milled from solid aluminium to create a perfect space for it. The milled logo on the high-endurance anodised surface shows the aluminium material under the anodizing.\n\nANATOMICAL, ERGONOMIC DESIGN FOR LONG LISTENING SESSIONS\n\nMeze has designed the Rai Penta's housings to be durable, comfortable and easy to use. The rounded edges are designed to mimic the natural curves of the human ear for a more secure and comfortable fit. It's purely made for the true audiophile to spend hours and hours listening to this beauty.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY CABLES AND CONNECTORS\n\nThese IEMs have been designed with high-purity silver-plated copper wires and use finely crafted metal plugs shells. This ensures that the assembled cables are strong enough for a long time. Each of the 4 wires consists of 20 Litz strands. For the best connectivity and durability, the MMCX plugs are crafted from high-quality materials including a rhodium-plated plug termination.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\nPenta-Hybrid Drivers\n\n4 x Customized Balanced Armature 1 x Dynamic Driver\n\nIMPEDANCE\n20 Î©\n\nSENSITIVITY\n110 dB spl/1mW Sensitivity\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 Hz - 45 kHz\n\nDISTORTION\nless than 1%\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMMCX connector\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE\n2.5mm Balanced Cable, 3.5mm connector\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

This is done with its 50mm dual-diaphragm drivers and superior materials. With this headphone, you can experience pure audio without the artificial processing of battery-powered headsets. To ensure that these are ready for use and can consistently hit all notes, the Crossfade LP2 is tested at 6 different frequencies.\n\nFLEXIBLE. STURDY. RUGGED.\n\nBe it a range of temperatures, salt spray, humidity or UV exposure, the Crossfade LP2 will never let you down.

Just slip it in the Exoskeleton case & you're good to go.\n\nERGONOMIC FIT FOR MAXIMUM ISOLATION AND MINIMUM SOUND LEAK\n\nMore than 4 years of R&D have resulted in the ergonomic headband and hexagon-shaped earcups that does away with fatigue.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Mezeâ€™s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mmÂ² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils â€” Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An IsomagneticÂ® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Î©\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANARÂ®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

It features the very same drivers as the LCD-X (Music Creator's Special), but in a closed-back design. This allows for better noise isolation and minimal sound leakage.\n\nMADE FOR AUDIO PROFESSIONALS\n\nAudeze headphones are trusted by professional engineers and music producers as their new reference.

The wide frequency range from 10Hz to 50kHz allows experts to easily pinpoint each element in a track, making mixing more accurate.\n\nEXTENDED FREQUENCIES & LOWER DISTORTION WITH FAZORS\n\nFazors are special acoustical elements positioned on either side of the magnetic structure. They enhance transparency by affecting the sound waves generated by large planar diaphragms. A few of the benefits include extended frequency response, improved high-frequency extension and lowered distortion, with better imaging.\n\nAUDEZE'S INNOVATIVE PLANAR MAGNETS\n\nAcoustically engineered for accuracy Audezeâ€™s innovative planar magnetic technology delivers a clear and accurate sound that reveals everything on the recording. The LCD-XC (Music Creator's Special) has an efficient push-pull magnetic structure that is specially designed and self-closing. This ensures an acoustically transparent music listening experience. The double-sided Neodymium magnet arrays deliver a uniform driving force across the entire diaphragm for a near-zero distortion.\n\nPROPRIETARY LOTUS DIAPHRAGM FOR A SMOOTH SOUND\n\nAudeze's proprietary Lotus diaphragm has a printed circuit across most of its surface and is capable of handling maximum continuous operating temperatures of over 400Â° F. This gives the drivers a smooth, resonance-free frequency response, excellent internal damping, edge damping, very low distortion and an extremely fast transient response.\n\nMIX & MASTER ANYWHERE & EVERYWHERE\n\nNot everyone can listen to their headphones in an acoustically treated room. With the Audeze Reveal plugin, you can add custom filter presets to all Audeze flagships. Now, mix and master in virtually any location, be it the studio, your home or even on top of an active volcano.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n15W\n\nIMPEDANCE\n20 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n102dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5Hz â€“ 20kHz extended out to 50kHz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nNeodymium\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm to 1/4in stereo adaptor\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nCABLE TYPE\n2.5m 1/4in to dual 4-pin mini-XLR cable\n\nWEIGHT\n543g\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

It gives you reference-quality audio that is very spacious thanks to the custom engineering drivers from Sennheiser. Every note sounds vivid and life-like, just the way the sound engineer intended it to be. The Sennheiser HD 820s sport a closed, circum-aural dynamic stereo headphone design that makes you feel directly connected to the music. Music emerges from silence and sounds so profound that would travel into a soundstage of amazement.\n\nOPEN SOUND IN A CLOSED FORM FACTOR\n\nMost audiophiles feel that music can truly be enjoyed only with the wide spaciousness of an open-back headphone. But, the Sennheiser HD 820 is here to change that with its special Ring Radiator transducers and unique glass covers. These covers are concave in shape and reflect the sound waves from the drivers to an absorber, thus giving you a similar open sound. Soundstage refers to being able to sense the spatial surroundings of a recording.\n\nINGENIOUS KEVLAR-REINFORCED CABLES FOR MINIMAL LOSS\n\nEach and every part of the HD 820 has been crafted by experts to give you the best performance. The impedance-matching cable is specially tuned and symmetrical to reduce capacitance. It has silver-wrapped OFC wires and ends with a balanced 4.4mm gold-plated jack. This offers superior contact resistance.\n\nCOMFORTABLE CIRCUMAURAL DESIGN WITH ALCANTARA EARCUPS\n\nThe Japanese Alcantra Earcups boast of suede-like fabric material that youâ€™ll find used for the interior of many high end automobiles and racecars. It definitely feels like an airy version of suede, as it doesn't have the heft of most leather materials. Also the fabric breathes, which is great for long listening sessions when you donâ€™t want to have to air out your ears. Handcrafted ear pads made of high-quality microfiber fabric and the ear cups are covered with a thin metallic mesh.\n\nCRAFTED WITH THE BEST, FOR THE BEST\n\nOnly high-quality materials are used to make this headphone. This includes the comfortable handcrafted earpads as well as the robust metal headband.

    "description": "Designed in Japan\n\nFlat Sound Signature\n\n1 Year of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nElectrostatic Drivers\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nTangle-Free Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nYOUR VERY OWN CONCERT HALL, SOUNDS FOLD & CRAFTED TO PERFECTION\n\nThe SR-009S uses a diaphragm which consists of an ultra-thin plastic film. This film has a mass thatâ€™s close to zero and offers a high transient characteristic throughout the entire audio spectrum. The STAX SR-009S uses an evolved version of the Multilayer fixed electrode MLER (Multi-Layer-Elect-Rords) used in the SR-009. The edge of the electrode opening has been smoothened to reduce air resistance and improve sound permeability. To avoid resonance and the muddying of sound by such a thin electrode, it has been gold-plated with high specific gravity. This also gives you high speed, clarity, silky details and powerful texture. The guard mesh on the outer part of the headphone has been curved to increase sound intensity, improve resolution and lower the influence of sound reflection. The arc-shaped headband has a 10-step slider making it easier to adjust it to just about any head size.\n\nHIGH PURITY, NOTHING ELSE, LIGHTWEIGHT BUT DURABLE & SUPERIOR COMFORT\n\nThe cables used in the SR-009S are similar to those used in the wiring of large-scale integration circuits or high-end audio cables. The copper wire has a purity of 99.9999% (6Nines). This is further silver-coated and finished for a better structure. Just about every part of the SR-009S is made of precise machine processed aluminium. This ensures that it is lightweight as well as durable. The thickness of the case has been reduced as much as possible to make the flow of condensation-and-rarefaction airwave from the sound element more smooth and to reduce resonance. The SR-009S has been crafted by experts. The soft earpads are made using the perfect blend of genuine lambskin leather and high-quality synthetic leather. This avoids sweaty ears and ensures long and comfortable listening sessions.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5 - 42,000Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n145k Î© (Including Cable, At 10kHz)\n\nSOUND PRESSURE SENSITIVITY\n101dB / 100V R.m.s. 1 KHz\n\nBIAS VOLTAGE\n580V DC\n\nMAXIMUM SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL\n118dB / 400Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nTYPE\nPush-Pull Open Back Circular Electrostatic Headphone\n\nELECTROSTATIC CAPACITANCE\n110pF (Including Cable)\n\nLEFT & RIGHT CHANNEL IDENTIFICATION \"L\" And \"R\" Indicated On The Arc Assembly (Inside Head Spring) Left Channel Cable Is Marked With A Solid Line.

In order to claim warranty, please visit our Audio-Technica warranty page. We are very helpful guys, just saying.\n\nThe sound signature of the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x is?\n\nVery flat. Essentially made for professional studio monitoring, you can expect a neutral sound from the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. Bassheads, leave now before you set yourself up for disappointment.\n\nIs the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x ideal for DJs?\n\nNo, they are not. You can have a look at the V-MODA Crossfade LP2 as it is ideal for DJ and live shows.\n\nDoes the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x come with an open-back design?\n\nNo, it doesnâ€™t. If you are looking for a wide soundstage our top recommendation will be the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro. It features an open-back design with much more detailing as compared to the ATH-M50x.\n\nWill Audio-Technica ATH-M50x require an Amp?\n\nAlthough your smartphone and laptop will be able to drive it, an amplifier would certainly bring out the true potential of the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. Read more about amplification and why it's important here.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x and the Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro?\n\nThe Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro will have a flatter response, as accurate to the source as possible. The Audio-Technica ATH-M50x will have relatively extended low end in comparison.\n\nDoes detachable cable mean I can use it without the wire as well?\n\nNo, they canâ€™t. Detachable cables mean they can be replaced when they go south!\n\nAre Audio-Technica ATH-M50x built to last? Could I use it when travelling?\n\nYes, they are durable and are travel friendly since they fold and a travel carry pouch is also included with the product.\n\nCould I change the parts if they wear out?\n\nYes, we provide high quality replacement parts for the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. You can replace the headband and the earpads from Headphone Zone directly.\n\nHow many cables does the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x come with?\n\nThe product comes with 3 cables: 3.9 to 9.8' (1.2 to 3 m) Coiled Cable, 9.8' (3 m) Straight Cable and 3.9' (1.2 m) Straight Cable. Who doesn't like options?\n\nWhat devices is the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x compatible with?\n\nThese headphones are mostly used by studio professionals and come with a 6.3mm adaptor for use with consoles. You can also use the 3.5mm jack with your laptop or smartphone.\n\nIs Audio-Technica ATH-M50x an ideal product for everyday casual use?\n\nIdeally no. Because these require a dedicated amp for the best quality and because they're quite flat sounding, we wouldn't recommend these to casual music listeners.\n\nHow do Audio-Technica ATH-M50x stack up against Ultrasone Performance 820?\n\nBoth these headphones are flagship products under the 10k range having their strenghts and usability.

But the latest version of the Sundara is perhaps the best. You need a serious amplifier to drive this planar magnetic headphone but paired properly, these are a fantastic headphone for any audiophile.\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone.

The aluminium headband is lightweight but durable. The adjustable headband and earpads are made of synthetic leather and offer comfort of the highest order.\n\nLOOKS AS GOOD AS IT SOUNDS\n\nJust like its sound, HiFiMANâ€™s Sundara looks gorgeous too.

On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î©.\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this HiFiMAN Sundara comes with a 1 year warranty from HiFiMAN that covers manufacturing defects.

It is a combination of an over-ear with a special tube amplifier that offers a sound worthy of it. This custom-made amp features the finest 300B tubes for an audio quality like none other.\n\n24-SETUP LEVEL OF VOLUME CONTROL\n\nSay goodbye to noise, even during the slightest change in volume. The 24-step level of volume control uses 23 separate resistors. This makes each volume level independent of the others.\n\nHIGHLY OPTIMIZED THIN DIAPHRAGM FOR CLEAR SOUND\n\nFor the best sound experience, the Shangri-La comes with a diaphragm that is so fine (0.001mm), it is thinner than a strand of human hair. It has a nanoparticle coating which enables it to move extremely fast and gives you an unsurpassed high-frequency response.\n\nDISTORTION FREE SUPERIOR SONIC EXPERIENCE\n\nEnjoy music that flows through a range of frequencies from 7Hz to 120KHz. Like the diaphragm, even the metal mesh stators have a super-fine grating that let sound waves lower than 1 million hertz pass through without any distortion. The stators are crafted using a specialised metallic alloy. This gives you sonic stability with acoustically transparent audio.\n\nEXPERIENCE 300B FOR REAL\n\nMost headphones/amps come with transformers and capacitors to increase the voltage and drive the diaphragm. The Shangri-La has neither. Thus, nothing comes between the headphone and amp and you can directly listen to the four 300B vacuum tubes.\n\nFLAGSHIP LEVEL COMFORT WITH SOFT HEADBAND, SPACIOUS EARPADS\n\nThe Shangri-La has been designed keeping in mind long music-listening sessions. The headphone is lightweight while the soft head pad is adjustable and ensures supreme comfort. The open-backed design gives you a view of the driver hard at work. Visitors are certainly going to come over for a second look.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nNanotech Driver\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7Hz - 12kHz\n\nBIAS VOLTAGE\n550-650V\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear (Circumaural)\n\nHEADPHONE STYLE\nOpen-Back\n\nWEIGHT\n13.2oz (374g)\n\nDIMENSIONS\n17.32\" x 18.11\" x 13.39\" (437.8*458.9*335.8mm)\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

To claim warranty read more here.\n\nWhat sort of headphone is this?\n\nThe Shangri-La is an electrostatic headphone. It uses a diaphragm that is statically charged and is repelled/attracted to the stators nearby. You can read more about it here.\n\nElectrostatic...hmmm...is there any danger of getting a shock?\n\nNo, these headphones are absolutely safe and you do not need to worry about getting a shock. There are many resistors to keep the current low. There is also a relay-based system that cuts off the output if there is any problem in the amp.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Shangri-La and Shangri-La jr?\n\nIn a nutshell: The Shangri-La has a 300B vacuum tube amp while the Shangri-La jr has a 6SN7N vacuum tube amp. An important decision. Choose wisely.\n\nIs there any risk of arcing?\n\nArcing is a situation when the voltage passing through the headphone increases suddenly and is transferred from one electrode to the diaphragm/ other electrode. This can cause heavy damage to the driver unit. Fortunately, the Shangri-La comes with a nanometer-thick dust cover that prevents arcing.\n\nBuying Guide\n\nThe World's Most Expensive Headphones You Won't Believe Exist\nby Abhijeeth Shetty May 09, 2020\nThe sole purpose of these expensive headphones is to deliver the ultimate music listening experience which you won't find in low-end headphones.\nRead More\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this HiFiMAN Shangri-La comes with a 1 year warranty from HiFiMAN that covers manufacturing defects.

However, unlike other STAX Earspeakers, it features a different design for its deep powerful sound and is hence, an Earspeaker like no other. The unique electrode structure has a gold-plated outer edge. Unlike other Earspeakers, these electrodes do not have any holes, causing the diaphragm to vibrate more. This not only gives you a rich powerful sound but also lets you experience the delicate details in your music.\n\nRIGID METAL HOUSING, EXTREME COMFORT & HIGH-QUALITY AUDIO\n\nTo thoroughly eliminate distortion, STAX encases the sound element in a thick insulated resin case. This case is firmly attached to the SR-007MK2â€™s body. This makes sure that only the diaphragm vibrates, giving you a sound thatâ€™s almost magical. The SR-007MK2 is made for long listening sessions. The soft lambskin earpads are adjustable so that they fit your head perfectly. For a great sound, the SR-007MK2 uses a Pure Crystal Ohno Continuous Casting (PC-OCC) cable. This 2.5m (8.2 feet) cable has a low capacity and wide format which ensures that you only get high-quality audio when you plug it in.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n6 - 41,000Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n170k Î© (10kHz)\n\nSENSITIVITY\n100dB / 100V r.m.s. 1 kHz\n\nBIAS VOLTAGE\n580V DC\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nTYPE\nPush-Pull electrostatic circular sound element, Open-Air type enclosure\n\nCAPACITANCE\n94pF (including cable)\n\nLEFT & RIGHT CHANNEL IDENTIFICATION\n'L' and 'R' indicated on the cable entrance point, solid line (left) and dotted line (right) on the cable\n\nCABLE\nLow capacity wide format, PC-OCC (Pure Crystal Ohno Continuous Casting) 2.5m/8.2ft\n\nAMBIENT TEMPREATURE AND HUMIDITY\n0 to 35ÂºC / 90% max. without condensation\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nEAR PADS\nGenuine Lamb Leather (direct skin contact), high-quality synthetic leather (surrounding portion)\n\nWEIGHT\n12.9oz without cable / 1.1lb with cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

Can I carry it along with me?\n\nThe SR-007MK2 is an open-backed headphone so it is certainly not the best option for a long commute. But if youâ€™d prefer a headphone for listening at home, this should certainly be your pick. Still confused? Maybe this article could help you out.\n\nWhat is the cable like?\n\nThe SR-007MK2 has a 2.5m wide Pure Crystal Ohno Continuous Casting (PC-OCC). Itâ€™s quality at its best!\n\nWhat is the warranty like and whom should I contact?\n\nSTAX offers a manufacturerâ€™s warranty of 1 year. In case you need to claim warranty or read more about it, hereâ€™s the place you need to be.\n\nCan I use the SR-007MK2 with my phone?\n\nNope, you canâ€™t. The STAX SR-007MK2 has an impedance of 145K Ohms. Headphones with higher impedance need more power to run and your smartphone wonâ€™t be able to generate that. You will need an amp for this. To understand more about impedance and its effect on your beloved headphone, check out this article.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this STAX SR-007MK2 comes with a 1 year warranty from STAX that covers manufacturing defects.

An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away.

Seeing the popularity of the original LCD-2, Audeze decided to bring it back in a new & improved version â€” the LCD-2 Classic.\n\nAUDEZE'S PLANAR MAGNETIC MAGIC\n\nUnlike a dynamic driver with a cone or dome attached to a round voice coil, Audeze's flat, thin-film diaphragm has a printed circuit across most of its surface. When the circuit is energized with an audio signal it interacts with the magnets that move the diaphragm back and forth, creating a larger than life sound. Further, the double-sided magnet arrays deliver a uniform driving force across the entire diaphragm for a near-zero distortion.\n\nHANDCRAFTED WITH PREMIUM MATERIALS\n\nMade in the USA, the Audeze LCD-2 Classic are handcrafted using high-quality luxurious materials. It features Audeze's tonal balance and powerful bass that beautifully articulates the power and nuance of your favourite music. The gorgeous wooden rings are designed for the audiophile with a discerning ear & style.\n\nMIX & MASTER ANYWHERE & EVERYWHERE\n\nNot everyone can listen to their headphones in an acoustically treated room. With the Audeze Reveal plugin, you can add custom filter presets to all Audeze flagships. Now, mix and master in virtually any location, be it the studio, your home or even on top of an active volcano.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n15W\n\nIMPEDANCE\n70 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n101dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n10Hz â€“ 50kHz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nNeodymium\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nGRILL\nOpen-Back\n\nCABLE TYPE\n1.9m 1/4in to dual 4-pin mini-XLR cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

The electrostatic headphones operate on a an unconventional level unlike other headphones that feature dynamic and moving coil designs. In most headphones, the drivers are heavier, making it difficult to recreate detail in playback due to mass. To keep the quality of music from deteriorating, the Stax SR-L300 uses an Oxygen Free Copper (OFC). This cable uses a wide flat structure to reduce the capacitance between wires and to drive it effectively so that your music always sounds its best.\n\nARTIFICIAL LEATHER EARPADS, EXTREME COMFORT\n\nEverything about the SR-L300 is made to enhance the sound and your listening experience.

Rather than resorting to artificially tuned frequencies, the drivers provide dynamic contrast for a more natural listening experience.\n\nCOMFORTABLE FOR LONG LISTENING SESSIONS\n\nMeze has done exhaustive research in order to find the right material and technology for each component of the 99 Neo. To combat discomfort of any kind, the manganese spring steel headband delivers even pressure for any head size. The earcups consist of memory foam earpads and soft PU leather making these perfect for long listening sessions.\n\nBUILT TO BE STYLISH AND DURABLE\n\nThe headphones have cast zinc alloy hardware with an electroplated coating, stamped manganese spring steel headband and internal components are made of durable ABS and silicone parts. Construction uses no glue, just nuts and bolts. The cables are made with kevlar fibres, thereby combining the best of craftsmanship and sturdiness.\n\nSERVICEABLE IN EVERY PART\n\nThe Meze 99 Neo is built to last you generations with its replaceable parts and sturdy build. Besides the usual warranty that every brand offers, the 99 Neo's parts are endlessly serviceable. Each component can be easily substituted for another. So, if any part of the headphone is damaged you can simply replace it instead of going for a new pair of headphones.\n\nSPECS\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n40mm\n\nIMPEDANCE\n26Î©\n\nSENSITIVITY\n103dB at 1KHz, 1mW\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15Hz - 25kHz\n\nRATED INPUT POWER\n30mW\n\nMAXIMUM INPUT POWER\n50mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm gold plated\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n260g (without cables)\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nEAR CUPS\nABS Plastic\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

It then goes through sanding, lacquering, finishing, careful inspection and is finally assembled.\n\nSpecs\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n40mm\n\nIMPEDENCE\n32 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n103 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15Hz - 25,000Hz\n\nRATED INPUT POWER\n30mW\n\nMAXIMUM INPUT POWER\n50mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n260g\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nEAR-CUPS\nWalnut Wood\n\nCABLE\nKevlar OFC cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nWHAT YOU WILL GET\n\n1.

For more warranty details click here.\n\nWhat is the difference between DT 1990 Pro and Amiron Home?\n\nAs a reference headphone for studio applications, the DT 1990 PRO features an accurate resolution and a differentiated stereo image. With a detailed reproduction of highs, it is the ideal tool for a precise analysis of the audio material to be processed. The Amiron home unfolds its full potential mainly at home. It combines a very precise bass with transparent mids and pleasantly clear highs. Its warm, laid-back sound with a fascinating spaciousness is excellently suitable for a relaxed listening to the music and provides a top-class audiophile listening experience..\n\nWhich plug is used for the detachable cable of DT 1770 / 1990 Pro?\n\nThis is a three-pin mini-XLR connection, the male part in the left earcup, the female one on the cable. Pressing the small button on the female plug unlocks the connection. The pin assignment is as follows: (3) - left hot, (2) - right hot, (1) - common return. The other end of the cable is equipped with a stereo minijack (1/8\") with a screwable 1/4\" adapter.\n\nWhat's the difference between the DT 770/990 Pro and the DT 1770/1990 Pro?\n\nThe DT 770/990 PRO is made for musicians, sound engineers, producers as well as beginners looking for a reliable, sturdy and affordable pair of headphones as a working device. The DT 1770/1990 PRO was developed for sound engineers, producers, and musicians looking for a pair of high-end studio headphones with uncompromising performance in all relevant aspects such as sound, design, comfort, and accessories.\n\nWhat do \"Impedance\" and \"Ohms\" mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î© like the T 1.\n\nHow is the overall sound of Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 Pro?\n\nBeyerdynamic is a German brand that has made its mark as a fine headphone manufacturer and the DT 1990 Pro model gives a warm and smooth sound.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO come with a mic?\n\nNo, the Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pro does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nIs the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO an over the ear or on the ear product?\n\nIt is a open-back over-the-ear headphone which makes listening to music better since it gives that natural sound output.\n\nHow is the overall fit of Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO?\n\nBeyerdynamic - DT 1990 Pro fits over the ear and has plush earpads, making it a comfortable headphone to wear for long hours at a stretch.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO have detachable cables?\n\nYes, the cables are indeed detachable. Making for easy storage and convenient for whenever you want replace or upgrade cables.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO work well and loud enough with mobile phones ?\n\nIt gives enough output to be loud but then it also depends on your phone's internal amp and DAC\n\nAre the DT 1990 PRO good for long useage?\n\nYes, you can use the DT 1990 Pro for a long time as it comes with high-tech textiles, and memory foam filled ear pads ensure exceptional wearing comfort.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO need an Amplifier?\n\nYes, since it has a high impedence which cannot be driven by a smartphone an Amp gives it the extra boost to the sound.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Beyerdynamic DT 1990 PRO comes with a 2 year warranty from Beyerdynamic that covers manufacturing defects.

This is done with its 50mm dual-diaphragm drivers and superior materials. With this headphone, you can experience pure audio without the artificial processing of battery-powered headsets. To ensure that these are ready for use and can consistently hit all notes, the Crossfade LP2 is tested at 6 different frequencies.\n\nFLEXIBLE. STURDY. RUGGED.\n\nBe it a range of temperatures, salt spray, humidity or UV exposure, the Crossfade LP2 will never let you down. It is built with a steel frame and interchangeable aircraft-grade metal shields. The SteelFlex headband is so flexible, it can bend flat more than 10 times while the cable can bend over a million times. The V-MODA Crossfade LP2 is tested according to Military-Level Quality MIL-STD-810G Test Standards. You can also carry your Crossfade LP2 safely wherever you'd like. Just slip it in the Exoskeleton case & you're good to go.\n\nERGONOMIC FIT FOR MAXIMUM ISOLATION AND MINIMUM SOUND LEAK\n\nMore than 4 years of R&D have resulted in the ergonomic headband and hexagon-shaped earcups that does away with fatigue.

An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away. On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nBRINGING THE TESLA TO THE STUDIO\n\nTaking the Tesla Technology to a studio reference headphone for mixing, mastering and monitoring: the DT 1770 Pro features a modern and elegant design with components including end pieces, yokes, ear cups and headband that are very durable.\n\nDESIGNED FOR STUDIO PROFESSIONALS AND AUDIO ENGINEERS\n\nThe DT 1770 PRO is a perfect circumaural headphone for high-end studio use of mixing and mastering. Due to its closed design with a high ambient noise attenuation, it is perfect for users in loud environments such as sound engineers when listening to PA systems or musicians.\n\nMAXIMUM PRECISION, MINIMUM LEAKAGE\n\nThe closed-back design offers a wide soundstage and excellent resolution together with a precise, natural bass output making these headphones the top pick for professional studio use. Background noise is effectively suppressed, and leakage minimized thanks to the closed-back design. The DT 1770 Pro walks the fine line between pure flat response and slight boosting in certain frequency ranges to allow for clarity, richness, and depth. The clean highs are balanced with full-bodied, deep bass.\n\n45MM DYNAMIC TESLA DRIVERS\n\nEmploying Beyerdynamic's Tesla 2.0 technology for the first time in professional headphones, the drivers utilize a triple layer composite diaphragm to reduce \"partial oscillations,\" which results in a more detailed audio performance.\n\nRUGGED BUILD AND REPLACEABLE COMPONENTS\n\nThe DT 1770 PRO is very durable. The headband has been constructed from steel and replaceable headband pads that are high on comfort for long listening sessions. All components are replaceable and ensure a long lifetime of the headphone.\n\nTWO PAIRS OF EARPADS, TWO SOUNDS\n\nTwo pairs of ear pads are included in order to achieve the ideal sound characteristic depending on the use case. Velour ear pads provide an open sound and are perfect for mixing and mastering. A pair of leatherette ear pads provide a more closed sound making the headphones more well suited to monitoring applications.\n\nA PLETHORA OF ACCESSORIES\n\nThe headphones come with two detachable cables, one straight and one coiled; a premium protective carry case, two sets of velour & leatherette earpads and two gold-plated Â¼-inch headphone jack adapters.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n45 mm\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nTesla Driver\n\nMAGNET\nNeodymium\n\nIMPEDANCE\n250Î©\n\nSENSITIVITY\n102 dB @ 1 kHz\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5Hz - 40,000Hz\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n200 mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n388g\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

For more warranty details click here.\n\nHow is the overall sound of Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 Pro?\n\nBeyerdynamic is a German brand that has made its mark as a fine headphone manufacturer and the DT 1770 Pro model gives clean highs along with a deep bass sound.\n\nWill the DT 1770 Pro replace the DT 770 Pro?\n\nYes, the DT 1770 PRO is an advanced version of the DT 770 PRO, made for audio engineers, producers and musicians who need a pair of high-end studio headphones with uncompromising performance in all relevant aspects such as sound, design, comfort, and accessories.\n\nWhich plug is used for the detachable cable of DT 1770 / 1990 Pro?\n\nThis is a three-pin mini-XLR connection, the male part in the left earcup, the female one on the cable. Pressing the small button on the female plug unlocks the connection. The pin assignment is as follows: (3) - left hot, (2) - right hot, (1) - common return. The other end of the cable is equipped with a stereo minijack (1/8\") with a screwable 1/4\" adapter.\n\nWhat's the difference between the DT 770/990 Pro and the DT 1770/1990 Pro?\n\nThe DT 770/990 PRO is made for musicians, sound engineers, producers as well as beginners looking for a reliable, sturdy and affordable pair of headphones as a working device. The DT 1770/1990 PRO was developed for sound engineers, producers, and musicians looking for a pair of high-end studio headphones with uncompromising performance in all relevant aspects such as sound, design, comfort, and accessories.\n\nWhat do \"Impedance\" and \"Ohms\" mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î© like the T 1.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO come with a mic?\n\nNo, the Beyerdynamic DT 1770 Pro does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nIs the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO an over the ear or on the ear product?\n\nIt is a closed-back over-the-ear headphone which makes listening to music even better thanks to its natural noise isolation.\n\nHow is the overall fit of Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO?\n\nBeyerdynamic - DT 1770 Pro fits over the ear and comes with plush pads, which make it plenty comfortable for the majority of users.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO have detachable cables?\n\nThe cables are indeed detachable.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO work well and loud enough with mobile phones ?\n\nIt will work, but not well enough to do justice to the product. You would better off using these with a good DAC and Amplifier.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO need an Amplifier?\n\nYes, since it has a high impedence which cannot be driven by a smartphone an Amp gives it the extra boost to the sound\n\nBuying Guide\n\nBest Headphones for Dolby Atmos\nby Abhijeeth Shetty June 13, 2020\nThe given list of Dolby Atmos headphones will help you to experience the dynamics, depth, detail and clarity of audio like never before.\nRead More\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Beyerdynamic DT 1770 PRO comes with a 2 year warranty from Beyerdynamic that covers manufacturing defects.

This headphone has been lovingly handcrafted from wood and the satin-finished wood grain makes each headphone unique, just like your fingerprint. With these, Meze has worked to change the perception of headphones from being seen as technical devices or cheap plastic accessories to a mature product that you'll fall in love with.\n\nA RICH NATURAL SOUND\n\nEnjoy a crisp, balanced sound with the Meze 99 Classics. The 40mm neodymium drivers offer a clear, undistorted sound. Just sit back and put these on to enjoy the gorgeous sound of plucked strings, upbeat grooves or thumping beats that's natural and lifelike. In addition, the snug medium density memory foam keeps away noise while offering superior noise isolation.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY AND LUXURY IN EVERY ELEMENT\n\nApart from wood, the 99 Classics also use cast zinc and manganese spring steel. The headband ensures even pressure for long listening sessions. The headpad and earpads are made from PU leather. Everything is then put together using nuts and bolts. This makes the headphone fully serviceable. The entire headphone is made from only premium materials, no glue or plastic.\n\nMADE WITH CARE USING AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS\n\nEach Meze 99 Classics takes almost 45 days to be made. The wood used is harvested from mature trees that have reached the end of their life cycle. This ensures that there is no harm done to the environment while giving you that rich, natural sound. To further enhance the colours, the wood goes through extensive air drying and shaping by hand and CNC machines, a process that takes almost 8 hours. It then goes through sanding, lacquering, finishing, careful inspection and is finally assembled.\n\nSpecs\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n40mm\n\nIMPEDANCE\n32Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n103dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15Hz - 25,000Hz\n\nRATED INPUT POWER\n30mW\n\nMAXIMUM INPUT POWER\n50mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n260g\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nEAR-CUPS\nWalnut Wood\n\nCABLE\nKevlar OFC cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

Its best-in-class accuracy makes it an irreplaceable tool for those requiring the most transparent audio reproduction available. Step into a new world of music, full of rich detail, low-end clarity and overall accuracy.\n\nENJOY EXTENDED FREQUENCIES & LOWER DISTORTION\n\nThe LCD-3 uses Fazors, special acoustical elements positioned on either side of the magnetic structure. They enhance transparency by affecting the sound waves generated by large planar diaphragms. A few of the benefits include extended frequency response, improved high-frequency extension and lowered distortion, with better imaging.\n\nEXPERIENCE AUDEZE'S PROPRIETARY PLANAR MAGNETIC DRIVERS\n\nRather than use standard headphone drivers that operate like miniature woofers or tweeters, the LCD-3 uses a large, 6.17-square-inch thin-film planar magnetic driver that's embedded with Audeze's proprietary Lotus diaphragm that's thinner than a human hair for fast response times. This gives a smooth, resonance-free frequency response, excellent internal damping, edge damping, very low distortion and extremely fast transient response.\n\nMIX & MASTER ANYWHERE & EVERYWHERE\n\nNot everyone can listen to their headphones in an acoustically treated room. With the Audeze Reveal plugin, you can add custom filter presets to all Audeze flagships. Now, mix and master in virtually any location, be it the studio, your home or even on top of an active volcano.\n\nHANDCRAFTED WITH PREMIUM MATERIALS\n\nMade in the USA, the Audeze LCD-3 are handcrafted using high-quality luxurious materials. It features Audeze's tonal balance and powerful bass that beautifully articulates the power and nuance of your favourite music. The gorgeous wooden rings are designed for the audiophile with a discerning ear & style. The real lambskin leather or Microsuede earpads and headband use acoustical foam for the best fit and sound.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n15W (for 200ms)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n110 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n102dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5Hz â€“ 20kHz extended out to 50kHz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nNeodymium\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm to 1/4in stereo adaptor\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nCABLE TYPE\n2.5m 1/4in to dual 4-pin mini-XLR cable, 2.5m 4-pin XLR to dual 4-pin, Mini-XLR cable\n\nWEIGHT\n543g\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î©.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Shure SRH1540 comes with a 2 year warranty from Shure that covers manufacturing defects.

For more warranty details click here.\n\nHow is the overall sound of Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro?\n\nBeyerdynamic is a German brand that has made its mark as a fine headphone manufacturer and the DT 990 Pro model gives a neutral and clear sound.\n\nDoes Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro come with a mic?\n\nNo, the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nIs Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro an over the ear or on the ear product?\n\nIt is a semi open over-the-ear headphone which gives a slightly increased sound isolation and reduced noise leakage\n\nHow is the overall fit?\n\nBeyerdynamic DT 990Â Pro comes with an adjustable headband so that it firmly and comfortably cradles your head.\n\nDoes Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro have detachable cables?\n\nNo,it does not have detachable cable.\n\nWhich devices are compatible?\n\nThe DT 990 Pro is compatible with Android and iOS devices as well as studio monitoring eqiupments.\n\nIs Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro good for long useage?\n\nYes, due to it being durable, lightweight and soft earpads make music listening for long hours comfortable\n\nDoes it need an Amplifier?\n\nYes, since the driver units are bigger, they will need an amplifier so that the headphones can performance to its full potential.\n\nWhich hard case can I buy for my Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro?\n\nYou can get the Beyerdynamic - DT Hard Case for your DT 990 Pro.\n\nWhy isn't there a 600-ohms version of DT 990 Pro?\n\nSince most headphone output in professional environments isn't designed for 600-ohms headphones, Beyerdynamic only offers headphones with a maximum impedance of 250-ohms.\n\nWhat is the technical difference between DT 880/990 edition and DT 880/990 Pro?\n\nThe Pro series is designed for professional users and the Edition series are designed for end users. Also, the Pro and Edition series do not differ noticeably in terms of sound provided that they have the same impedance (e.g. the 250 ohms DT 880 Edition and the 250 ohms DT 880 Pro sound the same).\n\nHow does the Tygr 300 R differ from the DT 880 Pro and the DT 990 Pro?\n\nThe DT 880 PRO has a very linear frequency response, while the DT 990 PRO has a slightly more accentuated bass and accordingly more present trebles for a pleasant balance. Both are primarily designed for studio applications. The TYGR 300 R focuses on gaming. Powerful bass and detailed accentuated treble go very well with gaming. However, the sound design of the DT 990 PRO has been further optimized for gaming, sometimes through the use of a special acoustic fleece.\n\nHow can I tell what the impedance of my DT 770/880/990 Edition is?\n\nYou check the impedance of the integrated sound transducers from the connection plug. The impedance is sometimes hot-embossed onto the plastic shaft of the plug: If there is nothing there, the model has an impedance of 250 ohms. If it reads 32 Î©, the model has an impedance of 32 ohms. If it reads 600 Î©, the model has an impedance of 600 ohms.\n\nWhat do \"impedance\" and \"ohms\" mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Î©, 32 Î©, and 80 Î© are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Î© are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Î© like the T 1.\n\nAre the DT 990 Pro Available with less headband pressure?\n\nNo, the professional headphones are only available with the defined headband pressure. If the headband pressure is too strong for you, you can slightly try to expand the installed spring steel in the headband. For this purpose, we recommend stretching the headphones gradually for a few hours over books or similar. You should choose the width a little bit wider than the width of your head.\n\nBuying Guide\n\n10+ of the Best Over Ear Headphones in 2020\nby Abhijeeth Shetty May 09, 2020\nOver-ear headphones are one of the most popular types of headphones.

JH Audio - JH16V2 Pro Universal IEMs\n\n2. Wax Tool\n\n3. Screw Driver, used to adjust the variable bass\n\nSERVICE DETAILS\n\nWARRANTY\nNA\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nJerry Harvey\nJerry Harvey started his career as a sound engineer and shortly he picked up the legendary band Van Halen. Jerry Harvey thus came about the world's first Custom In-Ear Monitor. This became extremely popular with the band members and then he started making them for other brands as well. Jerry finally founded JH audio in 2007 as a manufacturer of custom aviation headsets and then started producing the JH Audio Pro series for professionals and audiophiles alike.\n\nPerformance-Series\nFor a custom-like experience, Jerry Harvey Audio has introduced the Performance series Universal Fit IEMs. These Universal series allows you to hear the music how the recording artist and mix engineer intended. The models achieve what no others have before: a smaller shell size to ensure proper fit, retention and an acoustic seal for a perfect IEM experience.\n\nEndorsed & Used by the Worldâ€™s biggest Rockstars\nJH Audio's Universal Fit Performance Series IEMs are currently endorsed and used by the worldâ€™s biggest touring artists like U2, Lady Gaga, Drake, Guns & Roses, Alicia Keys, and so many more. The Performance series is very popular and highly rated.\n\nHancrafted in USA\n\nHandcrafted, Never Mass-Produced\n\nThe Performance Series is truly exquisite in its design. After the unique shells go through the 3D printing process, the Universal IEMs are then, one pair at a time, finished and assembled in the JHA facility. Unlike other manufacturers that only match their IEMs within 3db +/- of their reference curves, JH Audio tests and matches their Universal IEMs to within an astounding 1db +/- of their reference curve. This level of attention to detail is simply unheard in this industry.\n\nSoundrIVe Technology (Quad Driver Technology)\nJH16V2 is equipped with SoundrIVe Technology, using Jerry Harvey Audioâ€™s proprietary mini quad drivers. The JH16V2 has a 10 driver configuration: quad drivers for the lows, dual drivers for the mids, and quad drivers for the highs. The FreqPhase corrects time and phase of multiple drivers. The waveguide ensures each driver signal arrives within 0.01 milliseconds, leading to a Phase coherent IEM.\n\nVariable Bass Output that is Adjustable from the Cable\nYou can control the low frequency drivers with the adjustable bass (0 - +10dB) from the cable itself. Frequency ranges from flat bass response up to +10dB (10Hz to 100Hz). The 4-pin cable connection from Moon Audio, thatâ€™s known for their incredible cables, provide a more secure and strong connection with the earpiece. It also helps to protect it from sweat and dust.\n\nYearlong Research for the Most Optimum Fit\nJH Audio is renowned worldwide for their custom IEMs that provide deep bass response and excellent sonic performance. With this kind of expertise, it was only natural that the engineers fine tune their Universal IEMs fit-wise, to be as close to Custom IEMs as possible. JH Audioâ€™s guys analyzed over 30,000 sets of ear molds in their Orlando Lab to find similarities in order to create the Performance Series IEMs. What they found was that most of the sound bores on Custom IEMs bore a similarity of having a 10% angle. Having identified this, JH Audio made the necessary sound bore adjustments and refined the shape of the ear bowl and helix area. The result? A Universal IEM that fits and seals almost as well as a Custom IEM.\n\nStunning Custom Black Pearl Faceplates\n\nEverything about the JH Audio Performance Series of Universal IEMs is stunning. Its new custom black pearl faceplates are adorned with oversized JH logos which you'd think look too over-the-top, but actually look pretty darn good-looking! The JH16V2 has an impressive and sophisticated crossover network. This crossover circuit combined with the Freqphase waveguide and new proprietary quad drivers deliver an audio quality that is perfect for the recording studio, or for listening to exactly what the mixer/producer and band wanted you to hear, mixing your own tracks or performing live.\n\nSee More\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n10 Drivers\n\nIMPEDANCE\n18 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n118dB @ 1mW\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n10Hz to 23kHz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE TYPE\nTangle-free cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

    "description": "Designed in Germany\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Movies and TV\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\n56mm Dynamic Drivers\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nOUTSTANDING REFERENCE QUALITY AUDIO REPRODUCTION\n\nThe Sennheiser HD 800s sport an open, circum-aural dynamic stereo headphone design that makes you feel directly connected to the music. Music emerges from silence and sounds so profound that would travel into a soundstage of amazement. Soundstage refers to being able to sense the spatial surroundings of a recording.\n\nPATENTED DYNAMIC TRANSDUCER TECHNOLOGY\n\nHeadphones have always had a basic physics problem when it comes to transducers. Better sound always requires a larger surface area but this also results in more distortion due to oscillation at high frequencies. Sennheiser essentially blew everyoneâ€™s mind when they showed off the Neodymium-powered two-layer ring radiator inside the HD 800 S. Firing at your ear in a strategic 60-degree angle to simulate free-air sound arrivals it has claimed to sport the largest diameter ever seen for such applications.\n\nRING RADIATOR DRIVER TECHNOLOGY FOR CONTROLLED OSCILLATIONS\n\nThe 56mm or 2.205\" (with a 40mm voice coil) is twice the size of your average tweeter. Generally, you don't encounter them until you shell out about 100 times that for the full speaker. This results in controlled oscillations, which leave the headphones to do what headphones do best, that is create the best and clearest sound possible.\n\nCOMFORTABLE CIRCUMAURAL DESIGN WITH ALCANTARA EARCUPS\n\nThe Japanese Alcantra Earcups boast of suede-like fabric material that youâ€™ll find used for the interior of many high-end automobiles and racecars. It definitely feels like an airy version of suede, as it doesn't have the heft of most leather materials. Also the fabric breathes, which is great for long listening sessions when you donâ€™t want to have to air out your ears. Handcrafted ear pads made of high-quality microfiber fabric and the ear cups are covered with a thin metallic mesh.\n\nINGENIOUS KEVLAR-REINFORCED CABLES FOR MINIMAL LOSS\n\n3 meters of fabric-sheathed Kevlar-reinforced Teflon-insulated 4-strand straight OFC copper wire in a Y harness. The cable is covered with a fabric sheath, making it flexible and non-microphonic. Two connection leads, a 6.3mm connector and an XLR-4 balanced cable to offer even better quality sound from sources with balanced outputs.\n\nOPEN-BACK DESIGN FOR AN AIRY, EXPANSIVE SOUNDSTAGE\n\nAny set of headphones that give a real sense of â€˜being thereâ€™ are open-backed, meaning that air and sound can come in and out of the headphones. The sound has less of a â€˜laboratory feelâ€™ this way. Itâ€™s not great for noise isolation, as people will be able to hear whatever music or movies that youâ€™re listening to.\n\nDESIGNED KEEPING WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION AND COMFORTABILITY IN MIND\n\nThe headphones come in at a pretty heavy sounding 11.5 oz (or 330 grams for the metric folk), but they manage to distribute the weight evenly so that you donâ€™t really notice the weight at all. They are large headphones and cover even the largest of ears. But they feel light and after a two-hour film, your head wonâ€™t be sore at all.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nTRANSDUCER PRINCIPLE\nDynamic Open\n\nIMPEDANCE\n300 Ohms\n\nTHD\n0.02 % (1 kHz 1 Vrms)\n\nCONTACT PRESSURE\n~ 3,4 N (Â± 0,3 N)\n\nSENSITIVITY\n102 dB @ 1 kHz\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 â€“ 51000 Hz (- 10 dB)\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n700 mW\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nNeodymium\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n6.35 mm/ 4.4 mm XLR-4 (optional)\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nWEIGHT\n330g\n\nCOLOR\nblack\n\nCABLE TYPE\nFabric-sheathed Kevlar-reinforced Teflon-insulated 4-strand straight OFC copper wire\n\nCABLE LENGTH\n3m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

It also makes the sound feel a bit more full bodied and comparatively warmer.\n\nHow do I know I'm making the right choice?\n\nWe understand that choosing a headphone can be a tough job having being given so many variations so this blog should help simplfy your doubts on the right choice on headphones\n\nBuying Guide\n\nBest Audiophile Headphones\nby Abhijeeth Shetty May 09, 2020\nThere are a lot of headphones available in the market posing themselves as audiophile headphones.
